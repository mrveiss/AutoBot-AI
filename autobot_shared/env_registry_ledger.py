"""Agent-ledger AUTOBOT_* environment variable registrations (#18391).

A sibling of ``env_registry_agent_runtime`` (which imports this module, because
it sits at the file-size ceiling and ``env_registry.py`` is closed to new
entries); the registration contract is the one ``env_registry`` states (#16415).
