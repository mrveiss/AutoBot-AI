"""The ledger's own record of coordination events nobody else keeps (#18391).

A claim that lapses, a release that addressed someone else's claim, and a yield
request are all things the registry used to forget the moment they happened:
Redis expires a claim silently, `release_scope` returns `False` and logs
nothing, and a yield request is a one-shot publish on a task channel. The read
APIs behind the agent-ledger screens need them, so they are written here --
a capped, expiring list beside the claims, in the same keyspace and Redis.

This is an *audit view*, not a second registry: nothing here grants, refuses or
orders a claim. Writing is best-effort and returns ``False`` on failure, because
the coordination fact it describes has already happened and must not fail on
its account; reading raises, so an unreachable ledger never looks empty.
