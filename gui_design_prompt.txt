Prompt for GUI Designing AI: Redesign or Enhance the AutoBot Interface

Description of the Current AutoBot GUI:

AutoBot is an autonomous AI agent platform with a web-based graphical user interface (GUI) designed to facilitate interaction between users and the AI system. The interface is built using Vue.js for the frontend, served on port 8080, with a FastAPI backend running on port 8001 for handling API requests and WebSocket communication for real-time updates. Below is a detailed description of the current GUI based on the codebase structure and functionality:

1. **Layout and Structure**:
   - The GUI is a single-page application with a responsive design, likely featuring a main content area for chat interactions and a sidebar or top navigation bar for accessing different functionalities.
   - The interface includes multiple sections or tabs for various features such as chat history, settings, file management, and knowledge base interactions, inferred from API endpoints like `/api/chat/history`, `/api/settings`, and `/api/files`.
   - A modal or popup system is used for specific actions like uploading files or adjusting settings, as suggested by frontend JavaScript files handling modals.

2. **Key Functional Elements**:
   - **Chat Interface**: The primary interaction point where users can input goals or messages to the AI. It supports real-time messaging via WebSocket (`/ws` endpoint) for immediate feedback from the AI, including responses, errors, and progress updates.
   - **Settings Panel**: A dedicated area for configuring the application, accessible via a settings button, allowing users to adjust parameters like LLM configurations, logging levels, and security settings (via `/api/settings` endpoint).
   - **File Browser**: A section for managing files, enabling users to upload, list, and delete files, which are then integrated into the knowledge base (`/api/uploadfile/` and `/api/files` endpoints).
   - **History View**: Displays past chat interactions and sessions, with options to load, save, or reset chat history (`/api/chat/history`, `/api/chat/save_session`, etc.).
   - **Action Buttons**: Includes buttons for actions like 'Pause Agent', 'Resume Agent', 'New Chat', 'Save Chat', 'Load Chat', and 'Reset Chat', inferred from console errors and API endpoints like `/api/agent/pause` and `/api/chat/reset`.

3. **Visual and Interactive Elements**:
   - The GUI likely uses icons or visual indicators for different sections (e.g., settings, files, history) as suggested by the presence of SVG files in `frontend/public/` (e.g., `settings.svg`, `file.svg`).
   - Interactive elements like buttons trigger API calls or WebSocket events, with immediate feedback shown in the console logs (e.g., errors for failed connections or 404s).
   - Toast notifications or error messages appear for user feedback on actions, as implied by `toast.css` in the frontend files.

4. **Current Challenges and Areas for Improvement**:
   - Some functionalities like 'Pause Agent' and 'Resume Agent' are placeholders and lack full backend integration, which may confuse users expecting immediate action.
   - The interface may experience connectivity issues or delays in fetching data, as seen in earlier CORS errors (now resolved) and WebSocket connection refusals.
   - The design might benefit from clearer visual hierarchy or more intuitive navigation between different sections to enhance user experience.

Design Objectives for the GUI Designing AI:
- Create a modern, user-friendly redesign of the AutoBot GUI that maintains the existing functionalities while improving usability and visual appeal.
- Ensure the interface is intuitive, with clear navigation between chat, settings, file management, and history sections.
- Incorporate visual cues or status indicators for placeholder functionalities (like 'Pause Agent') to manage user expectations until full implementation.
- Optimize the layout for responsiveness across different devices, ensuring accessibility on both desktop and mobile browsers.
- Enhance the chat interface to support rich text formatting or multimedia display if possible, to make interactions more engaging.
- Suggest a color scheme and typography that aligns with a tech-savvy, AI-driven application, possibly using futuristic or minimalistic design elements.
- **Critical Requirement**: The redesigned GUI must integrate seamlessly with the Vue.js framework, as the current frontend is built using Vue.js. Ensure that the design specifications and components are compatible with Vue.js for implementation.

Please provide wireframes, mockups, or detailed design specifications for the enhanced AutoBot GUI based on this description. Include suggestions for layout improvements, new features, and visual styling to elevate the user experience.
