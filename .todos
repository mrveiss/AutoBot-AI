# Service Authentication Enforcement Rollout Documentation

## Research Phase ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Analyze enforcement middleware implementation (85 exempt + 16 service-only paths)
- [x] Review logging middleware status (Day 3 deployed, 24hr monitoring)
- [x] Examine ServiceHTTPClient implementation (working on main backend)
- [x] Identify critical blocker (remote services not configured)
- [x] Review existing monitoring and rollout guides
- [x] Store research findings in Memory MCP

## Plan Phase ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Design comprehensive document structure (10 sections, ~20-25 pages)
- [x] Plan 4-phase rollout approach (Service Client → Soft → Circuit Breaker → Full)
- [x] Structure validation checklists for each phase
- [x] Plan rollback procedures documentation (emergency + standard)

## Implementation Phase ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Create comprehensive rollout plan document at docs/security/SERVICE_AUTH_ENFORCEMENT_ROLLOUT_PLAN.md
- [x] Document executive summary with current state and timeline
- [x] Document endpoint categorization details (85 exempt + 16 service-only)
- [x] Document Phase 1: Service Client Migration procedures (2-3 days)
- [x] Document Phase 2: Soft Enforcement with safety mechanisms (1-2 days)
- [x] Document Phase 3: Circuit Breaker gradual ramp (1 day)
- [x] Document Phase 4: Full Enforcement and production hardening
- [x] Document rollback procedures (emergency < 2min + standard)
- [x] Document monitoring requirements, metrics, and dashboards
- [x] Document risk matrix with mitigations and decision criteria
- [x] Create quick reference checklists and command reference
- [x] Store implementation findings in Memory MCP
