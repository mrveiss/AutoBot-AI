- ✅ **Installation Planning**: Generate installation guides for required tools

**Key Features:**
```python
# Intelligent tool availability checking
nmap_available = await self._check_tool_availability("nmap")

# Research-based tool discovery
tool_research = await self._research_scanning_tools("port scanning")

# Installation guide generation
install_guide = await self.get_tool_installation_guide("nmap")
```

### 2. **Network Discovery Agent** (`autobot-backend/agents/network_discovery_agent.py`)
**Capabilities:**
- ✅ **Host Discovery**: Multi-method host detection (ping, ARP, TCP)
- ✅ **Network Mapping**: Complete network topology analysis
- ✅ **Asset Inventory**: Categorized asset discovery and classification
- ✅ **ARP Scanning**: Local network device discovery
- ✅ **Traceroute Analysis**: Network path analysis
- ✅ **Service Enumeration**: Network service discovery

**Key Features:**
```python
# Multi-method host discovery
discovery_methods = ["ping", "arp", "tcp"]
hosts = await self._host_discovery(network, discovery_methods)

# Asset categorization
categories = {
    "servers": [],
    "workstations": [],
    "network_devices": [],
    "iot_devices": []
}
```

## 🔄 **Workflow Orchestration Integration**

### **Enhanced Task Classification**
- ✅ Added `SECURITY_SCAN` complexity type to workflow classification
- ✅ Updated classification agent to recognize security scanning requests
- ✅ Enhanced workflow planning for security-specific tasks

### **New Security Workflow Steps**
```python
elif complexity == TaskComplexity.SECURITY_SCAN:
    return [
        WorkflowStep(id="validate_target", agent_type="security_scanner"),
        WorkflowStep(id="network_discovery", agent_type="network_discovery"),
        WorkflowStep(id="port_scan", agent_type="security_scanner"),
        WorkflowStep(id="service_detection", agent_type="security_scanner"),
        WorkflowStep(id="vulnerability_assessment", user_approval_required=True),
        WorkflowStep(id="generate_report", agent_type="orchestrator"),
        WorkflowStep(id="store_results", agent_type="knowledge_manager")
    ]
```

### **Agent Registry Updates**
- ✅ Registered security agents in orchestrator
- ✅ Added workflow execution handlers for security tasks
- ✅ Integrated approval mechanisms for security operations

## 🔬 **Research Integration Features**

### **Intelligent Tool Discovery**
The security agents now dynamically research and recommend tools:

```python
# Example: Port scanning without pre-installed tools
scan_result = await security_scanner_agent.execute("port scan", context)

if scan_result["status"] == "tool_required":
    recommended_tools = scan_result["required_tools"]  # ["nmap", "masscan"]
    installation_guide = scan_result["research_results"]
    next_steps = scan_result["next_steps"]
```

### **Research Agent Integration**
- ✅ **Tool Research**: Automatic discovery of security tools for specific tasks
- ✅ **Installation Guides**: Research-based installation instructions
- ✅ **Package Manager Detection**: Smart detection of system package managers
- ✅ **Command Extraction**: Automatic extraction of installation commands
- ✅ **Fallback Recommendations**: Backup tool suggestions when research fails

---

## 🔒 **Security and Safety Features**

### **Target Validation**
```python
def _validate_target(self, target: str) -> bool:
    """Only allow scanning of authorized targets"""
    allowed_targets = ["localhost", "127.0.0.1", "::1"]

    # Check private IP ranges
    if ip.is_private:
        return True

    # Prevent external scanning
    return False
```

### **Approval Requirements**
- ✅ **User Approval**: Security scans require explicit user approval
- ✅ **Target Validation**: Prevents unauthorized external scanning
- ✅ **Tool Installation**: Installation requires user consent
- ✅ **Vulnerability Assessment**: High-risk scans require approval
