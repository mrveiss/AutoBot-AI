# External Applications & Research Documentation

This directory contains research, analysis, and documentation related to external AI/ML methods and applications that could enhance AutoBot's capabilities.

## Documents

### RAG Optimization Research
- **`Rag_optimization_methods.md`** - Converted article "Building a Temporal AI Agent to Optimize Evolving Knowledge Bases in Modern RAG Systems" by Fareed Khan (August 2025)
- **`RAG_OPTIMIZATION_ASSESSMENT.md`** - Comprehensive implementation assessment for AutoBot integration

### Source Files
- Original MHTML file (`Rag_optimization_methods.mhtml`) was moved to `/tmp/` to avoid git storage of large binary files
- Article was extracted using Playwright automation and converted to clean Markdown format

## Research Pipeline

1. **Source Collection**: External research articles saved as MHTML for offline access
2. **Content Extraction**: Playwright-based automation extracts clean text from web archives
3. **Format Conversion**: Convert to Markdown with proper structure and code formatting
4. **Integration Analysis**: Technical assessment of implementation potential in AutoBot
5. **Implementation Planning**: Detailed roadmaps with ROI analysis and resource requirements

## Assessment Criteria

For each external method/technology, we evaluate:
- **Technical Feasibility**: Compatibility with AutoBot's architecture
- **Business Value**: Impact on user experience and operational efficiency
- **Implementation Complexity**: Resource requirements and technical challenges
- **Integration Strategy**: Phase-based rollout plans and success metrics
- **ROI Analysis**: Cost-benefit analysis with quantitative projections

## Contributing

When adding new external research:
1. Save original source as MHTML for offline access
2. Extract and convert content using consistent formatting
3. Create comprehensive implementation assessment
4. Include technical integration examples and roadmaps
5. Provide ROI analysis and business justification
