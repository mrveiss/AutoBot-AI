## 🎯 What Happens Next

### When Agent Session Resets (After 7pm)

**Step 1: Launch 3 Agents in Parallel**

Open `planning/WEEK_1_QUICK_START.md` and copy the 3 Task() commands.

Send all 3 in a SINGLE message to launch agents in parallel:
- `database-engineer` - Schema initialization (Tasks 1.1, 1.2, 1.3)
- `senior-backend-engineer` - Startup integration (Task 1.4)
- `testing-engineer` - Comprehensive tests (Tasks 1.5, 1.6)

**Step 2: Monitor Progress (3-4 days)**

- Check Memory MCP for agent updates
- Track TODO list changes
- Watch for agent completion reports

**Step 3: Code Review (Day 3)**

- Launch `code-reviewer` agent
- Verify all implementations
- Run test suite

**Step 4: Verification (Day 4)**

Run automated verification:
```bash
bash scripts/verify-week-1-implementation.sh
```

**Step 5: Deployment (Day 5)**

- Deploy to staging
- Test fresh deployment scenario
- Verify all success criteria
- Deploy to production

---

## 📊 Week 1 Success Criteria

**Must Achieve:**

- ✅ Fresh deployment succeeds without manual DB setup
- ✅ All 5 tables created automatically:
  - conversation_files
  - file_metadata
  - session_file_associations
  - file_access_log
  - file_cleanup_queue
- ✅ Schema version tracked correctly
- ✅ Health check reports DB status
- ✅ Zero deployment failures
- ✅ 100% test coverage for initialization code
- ✅ All 6 VMs operational
