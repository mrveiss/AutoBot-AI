## Methodology
The analysis was performed using a combination of automated static analysis tools, codebase grep patterns, and cross-referencing existing documentation files (`docs/ROADMAP_2025.md`, `docs/project-roadmap.md`, `docs/CONSOLIDATED_TODOS_AND_ANALYSIS.md`).

## Key Conclusion
AutoBot is a powerful platform with a solid foundation. Immediate focus on **Security (Authentication)** and **Technical Quality (Code Consolidation)** will prepare the system for true enterprise-grade production readiness.
