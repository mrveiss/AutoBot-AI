## 🛡️ Security Hardening Achieved

### Defense in Depth
1. **Input Validation**: Command parsing and validation
2. **Risk Assessment**: Multi-level command classification
3. **Access Control**: Role-based permissions
4. **Execution Isolation**: Docker sandboxing
5. **Approval Workflows**: Human-in-the-loop for dangerous operations
6. **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging
7. **Monitoring**: Real-time security metrics

### Threat Mitigation
- ✅ **Command Injection**: Blocked dangerous patterns
- ✅ **Privilege Escalation**: Role-based access control
- ✅ **Resource Exhaustion**: Resource limits and timeouts
- ✅ **Data Exfiltration**: Sandbox isolation

## 🔄 Resilience Patterns Implemented

### Retry Patterns
- **Network Operations**: 5 attempts, 30s max delay, exponential backoff
- **Database Operations**: 3 attempts, 5s max delay, jittered backoff
- **File Operations**: 3 attempts, 2s max delay, linear backoff

### Circuit Breaker Patterns
- **LLM Services**: 3 failures threshold, 30s recovery, 120s timeout
- **Database Services**: 5 failures threshold, 10s recovery, 5s timeout
- **External APIs**: 2 failures threshold, 60s recovery, 15s timeout

### Graceful Degradation
