## 🎯 Architecture Decisions: What Changed and Why

This section documents key architectural decisions where the original plan was replaced with a different approach.

### 1. Agent Orchestration Framework

| Aspect | Original Plan | Current Implementation |
|--------|---------------|------------------------|
| **Framework** | LangChain | Custom Consolidated LLM Interface |
| **Status** | Replaced | ✅ Production |

**Why We Changed**:

- LangChain added abstraction layers that complicated debugging
- Framework updates frequently broke our integrations
- Custom implementation gives direct control over provider switching
- 2-3x performance improvement with custom approach
- LangChain being added back as optional complementary feature for specific use cases

### 2. Knowledge Retrieval System

| Aspect | Original Plan | Current Implementation |
|--------|---------------|------------------------|
| **Framework** | LlamaIndex | Custom RAG with ChromaDB |
| **Status** | Replaced | ✅ Production |

**Why We Changed**:

- LlamaIndex's document loaders didn't support our specific file formats
- Needed custom reranking algorithms for domain-specific content
- Background vectorization requirement wasn't well-supported
- Custom implementation provides hybrid search (semantic + keyword)
- 60% better retrieval accuracy with domain-tuned embeddings

### 3. Infrastructure Architecture

| Aspect | Original Plan | Current Implementation |
|--------|---------------|------------------------|
| **Deployment** | Single server | 5-VM distributed cluster |
| **Status** | Evolved | ✅ Production |

**Why We Changed**:

- Single server couldn't handle concurrent LLM inference + web automation
- GPU/NPU resources needed isolation from main application
- Redis required dedicated resources for 45,000+ keys
- Browser automation (Playwright) conflicts with desktop environment
- Fault isolation: one service failure doesn't crash entire system

### 4. Model Selection Strategy

| Aspect | Plan | Current Implementation |
|--------|------|------------------------|
| **Models** | Tiered: 1B/3B for agents, 7B for complex tasks | Mistral 7B for all tasks (temporary) |
| **Status** | Pending Optimization | ⏳ In Progress |

**Planned Model Architecture** (Target):

- **1B/3B Models** - For specialized agents (classification, routing, simple tasks)
- **Mistral 7B** - For complex reasoning, coding, orchestration
- **Goal**: Reduce resource usage while maintaining quality

**Current Implementation** (Temporary):

- **Mistral 7B Instruct** (`mistral:7b-instruct`) - Used for ALL task types:
  - Default LLM, Embedding, Classification, Reasoning
  - RAG, Coding, Orchestrator, Agent tasks
  - Research, Analysis, Planning

**Why Mistral 7B Temporarily for Everything**:

- Provides consistent baseline for development
- Ensures quality while tiered system is being designed
- 4.4GB model size fits in available VRAM/RAM
- Fast enough for interactive use (~1-3s response time)

**Pending Optimization**:

- Implement tiered model distribution
- Use smaller 1B/3B models for specialized agents
- Reserve 7B+ models for complex reasoning tasks
- Expected: Significant resource savings with minimal quality impact

**Current Configuration** (from `.env`):

```bash
AUTOBOT_DEFAULT_LLM_MODEL=mistral:7b-instruct
AUTOBOT_EMBEDDING_MODEL=mistral:7b-instruct
AUTOBOT_CLASSIFICATION_MODEL=mistral:7b-instruct  # TODO: Use 1B model
AUTOBOT_REASONING_MODEL=mistral:7b-instruct
# Future: tiered model distribution for specialized agents
```

### 5. Frontend Server Architecture

| Aspect | Original Plan | Current Implementation |
|--------|---------------|------------------------|
| **Servers** | Multiple dev servers allowed | Single frontend server (VM1 only) |
| **Status** | Replaced | ✅ Mandatory |

**Why We Changed**:

- Multiple frontend instances caused port conflicts
- WebSocket connections got confused between instances
- State synchronization issues between multiple frontends
- Single server ensures consistent user experience
- All development uses sync-to-VM workflow

### 6. Redis Database Structure

| Aspect | Original Plan | Current Implementation |
|--------|---------------|------------------------|
| **Databases** | 1 general database | 12 specialized databases |
| **Status** | Evolved | ✅ Production |

**Why We Changed**:

- Single database had key collision risks
- Different data types need different eviction policies
- Easier to monitor and debug isolated data streams
- Better performance with specialized configurations
- Clear separation: cache, vectors, sessions, analytics, etc.

### Summary: What We Kept vs Changed

**Kept from Original Vision**:

- ✅ Multi-agent architecture with 31 specialized agents
- ✅ Redis as primary data layer
- ✅ Vue 3 frontend framework
- ✅ FastAPI backend framework
- ✅ Ollama for local LLM inference

**Replaced with Better Approach**:

- ❌ LangChain → Custom LLM interface (performance + control)
- ❌ LlamaIndex → Custom RAG with ChromaDB (flexibility + accuracy)
- ❌ Single server → 5-VM cluster (scalability + isolation)
- ❌ TinyLLaMA/Phi-2 → Mistral 7B for all tasks (quality + consistency, pending optimization)
- ❌ Multiple frontends → Single VM1 frontend (stability)

## 📊 Original Roadmap Phases 18-21 (LangChain/LlamaIndex)

These phases from the archived roadmap were **replaced** with custom implementations:

| Original Phase | Original Plan | What Happened |
|----------------|---------------|---------------|
| Phase 18 | LangChain Agent Orchestrator | → Custom 31-agent system |
| Phase 19 | LlamaIndex Knowledge Base | → Custom RAG with ChromaDB |
| Phase 20 | LangChain LLM Integration | → Custom 8-provider interface |
| Phase 21 | LangChain Autonomous Agent | → Custom orchestrator with fallbacks |

**Rationale**: Custom implementations provided better performance, flexibility, and maintainability compared to framework-based approach.
