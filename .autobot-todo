# Week 1: Database Initialization Implementation - 2025-10-09

## RESEARCH PHASE (Current - In Progress)
- [x] Read implementation guide completely
- [x] Analyze current ConversationFileManager implementation
- [x] Analyze migration file (001_create_conversation_files.py)
- [x] Search Memory MCP for related work
- [x] Document current implementation status
- [ ] Launch database-engineer agent for technical analysis
- [ ] Launch systems-architect agent for architecture review
- [ ] Evaluate: Migration approach vs Guide's direct SQL approach
- [ ] Make architectural decision: Implement guide methods OR enhance migration system
- [ ] Validate decision with code-skeptic agent
- [ ] Store complete research findings in Memory MCP

## PLAN PHASE (Not Started)
- [ ] Solution selected based on research findings
- [ ] Break down implementation into specific tasks
- [ ] Assign tasks to specialized agents
- [ ] Identify dependencies and execution order
- [ ] Plan code review strategy
- [ ] Plan testing approach
- [ ] Document plan in Memory MCP
- [ ] Get approval to proceed

## IMPLEMENT PHASE (Not Started)
- [ ] Execute planned tasks with specialized agents
- [ ] MANDATORY: Code review by code-reviewer agent
- [ ] Run all tests (lint, typecheck, unit tests)
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Sync changes to remote VMs
- [ ] Verify deployment success
- [ ] Capture lessons learned in Memory MCP
