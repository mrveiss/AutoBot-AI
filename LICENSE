AutoBot Software License
========================

Copyright (c) 2025-2026 mrveiss. All rights reserved.


PREAMBLE
--------

This software is shared openly and without restriction. You are free to use
it, build with it, modify it, distribute it, and profit from it — no
permission needed, no fees, no gatekeeping.

This project exists because of time, effort, and a genuine desire to build
something useful and share it with the world. If it helps you build something
profitable, we simply ask that you consider giving something back — whether
that's code, financial support, or anything else that helps keep the project
alive and moving forward.

Every contribution, however small, directly supports the continuity of
AutoBot. It funds future development, keeps the project maintained, and
ensures that the Software remains available, improved, and free for everyone.
When you support the project, you are not just giving back — you are helping
guarantee that AutoBot continues to exist and grow for yourself and for
everyone else who depends on it.

There is no mandated amount. There is no enforcement mechanism for honest
people. This is an appeal to fairness, not a legal trap. If you profit from
this software and you choose to contribute something — however small — you
are doing the right thing and it is appreciated.

Everything below is there to make the terms clear and to protect both parties.


━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
SECTION 1 — DEFINITIONS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

"Software" means the AutoBot source code, compiled binaries, configuration
files, Ansible playbooks, shell scripts, frontend assets, backend services,
AI agent frameworks, documentation, and any other files included in or
distributed alongside this repository, in whole or in part, in original or
modified form.

"You" (or "Your") means any individual, organization, company, or legal
entity obtaining or using the Software in any way.

"Derivative Work" means any work that is based on or derived from the
Software, including modifications, adaptations, translations, ports,
extensions, wrappers, or works that incorporate a substantial portion of
the Software.

"Profit" means any net monetary gain — revenue minus directly associated
operating costs — derived from a product, service, offering, or activity
in which the Software or a Derivative Work plays a material role. This
includes, without limitation:

  - Net revenue from subscriptions, licenses, or sales of a product or
    service built using the Software;
  - Net fees received for consulting, integration, deployment, or managed
    services delivered using the Software;
  - Net advertising, sponsorship, or affiliate revenue generated through a
    platform that materially relies on the Software;
  - Net proceeds from licensing or sublicensing a Derivative Work;
  - Any other net financial gain in which the Software is a meaningful
    contributing factor.

  "Profit" does NOT include:
  - Gross revenue before deduction of reasonable, documented operating costs
    directly attributable to delivering the product or service;
  - Grants, scholarships, or non-profit funding for research or education;
  - Internal productivity gains or cost savings within a non-profit entity;
  - Pre-profit development, prototyping, or testing activity, regardless of
    future commercial intent;
  - Incidental, one-off, or de minimis revenue below a threshold of
    USD $1,000 in a calendar year.

"Copyright Holder" means mrveiss, the sole author and owner of all AutoBot
intellectual property.



━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
SECTION 2 — UNRESTRICTED GRANT OF RIGHTS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Subject to the profit-sharing obligation in Section 3 and the attribution
requirement in Section 4, the Copyright Holder grants You a worldwide,
perpetual, royalty-free, non-exclusive license to do anything with the
Software, including but not limited to:

  a) Use the Software for any purpose — personal, academic, research,
     internal, commercial, or otherwise;
  b) Copy and reproduce the Software, in whole or in part;
  c) Modify, adapt, extend, and create Derivative Works;
  d) Merge the Software into other projects, products, or systems;
  e) Publish, distribute, sublicense, and share the Software or Derivative
     Works, in source or binary form, to any party;
  f) Build and sell products and services that incorporate the Software;
  g) Use the Software to compete directly with the original project.

No prior permission is required. No fee is due upfront. No use case is
forbidden. The only condition is Section 3: if you profit, you share.


━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
SECTION 3 — SUPPORTING DEVELOPMENT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

If You generate Profit from any product, service, or activity in which the
Software plays a material role, we ask that You consider contributing back
to the project to support its continued development.

This is not a royalty, a tax, or a fee. It is an appeal to fairness from one
builder to another.

3.1 — YOU DECIDE HOW MUCH

The amount, form, and frequency of Your contribution is entirely Your choice.
You know your business and your situation better than anyone. Consider:

  - How central the Software is to what you built;
  - How much Profit you are generating because of it;
  - What you can reasonably afford to give back.

Contributions can take any form that genuinely helps the project:

  a) Financial: Any amount you consider fair, paid to the Copyright Holder
     or via the project's designated contribution channels;

  b) Code: Bug fixes, features, improvements, documentation, or tests
     submitted as pull requests to https://github.com/mrveiss/AutoBot-AI;

  c) Other: Infrastructure, promotion, tooling, mentorship, or any other
     support that helps sustain and grow the project.

No minimum. No ceiling. No approval needed. Just act honestly.

3.2 — WHEN THIS APPLIES

This ask applies once Your cumulative annual Profit attributable to the
Software exceeds USD $5,000 in a calendar year. Below that threshold, no
contribution is expected — go build freely.

Contributions are most meaningful when ongoing, reflecting a continuing
benefit rather than a one-time acknowledgment.

3.3 — LET US KNOW

If you are using the Software to build something profitable, we would love
to hear about it. Reach out via https://github.com/mrveiss/AutoBot-AI — not
because you are required to, but because it helps the maintainer understand
how the Software is being used, recognize contributors, and prioritize future
development.

3.4 — GOOD FAITH AND CONTINUITY

The only thing asked of you is honesty. If this Software helped you succeed,
do something — however small — to help it keep going.

By supporting the project, you directly ensure AutoBot's continuity. Open
software does not sustain itself. It requires ongoing work, maintenance,
and investment. Users who profit from AutoBot and choose to contribute back
are the reason the project can keep growing — and the reason it will still
be here, free and open, for the next person who needs it.

The project depends on the goodwill of those who benefit from it. Deliberately
and indefinitely profiting from the Software with no intent whatsoever to
contribute anything back is contrary to the spirit of this license. In such
cases, the Copyright Holder reserves the right to revoke the rights granted
under Section 2.


━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
SECTION 4 — ATTRIBUTION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

4.1 All copies or substantial portions of the Software — original or modified,
public or private — must retain:

  a) This complete license text, unmodified;
  b) The copyright notice: "Copyright (c) 2025-2026 mrveiss";
  c) Where reasonably practical, a reference to the original project at
     https://github.com/mrveiss/AutoBot-AI.

4.2 You may not misrepresent the origin or authorship of the Software. If You
distribute a Derivative Work, You must clearly identify what changes You made
to the original.

4.3 You may not use the name "AutoBot" or "mrveiss" to endorse or promote Your
products without prior written permission from the Copyright Holder.


━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
SECTION 5 — NO WARRANTY

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF
ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL THE

HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
