## Historical Context

**August 2025** was a major system overhaul period where AutoBot underwent significant architectural improvements:

1. **Performance**: Async operations, browser API improvements
2. **Observability**: Centralized logging, SEQ analytics
3. **Security**: Hardening, CI/CD integration
4. **Standards**: Service registry, agent protocols
5. **Documentation**: Indexing, validation, phase system

These improvements laid the foundation for the distributed architecture deployed in September-October 2025.
