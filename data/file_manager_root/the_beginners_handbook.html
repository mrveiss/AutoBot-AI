<em>without headaches</em></p>
<p><strong>– About this manual –</strong></p>
<p><strong>“The beginner’s handbook”</strong> is a simplified manual to
install and master the Debian system.</p>
<p>You will find in the following pages <strong>the answers to your
first questions</strong> concerning the <strong>Debian
GNU/Linux</strong> system <img src="img/logo/gnulinux.png" />, its
history, how to obtain it, to install it, to master it, to configure and
administrate it.</p>
<p>You will be able to <strong>go further</strong> and obtain
information concerning the privacy protection, the backing up of your
data, and the various actors of the Free Software world.</p>
<p>Usually, the manuals begin by teaching you the theoretical basis and
the usage of the terminal. This manual takes the very side of the
“graphical environment”: it is designed to let you start quickly with
Debian, screen powered on, fingers on the keyboard and the mouse nearby
<img src="img/smile/big_smile.png" />.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>– The mission of this manual is not to be comprehensive

class="header-section-number">1.1</span> The Debian GNU/Linux
system</h2>
<p><strong>Debian</strong> is an operating system <strong>free</strong>
(as in free speech) and <strong>gratis</strong> (as in free beer).
Debian allows your computer to function and offers you a full set of
<strong>Free Software</strong> for all the usual practices (surfing the
Web, sending emails, playing multimedia files, doing office kind of
tasks), and more …<img src="img/smile/smile.png" /><br />
This collection of Libre Software comes to a large extend from the <a
href="https://www.gnu.org/home.en.html">GNU project</a>, launched in
1983 by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman">Richard
M. Stallman</a>. The <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel">Linux kernel</a>
developed by <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds">Linus Torvalds</a>
then came to complete this set of software to make
<strong>GNU/Linux</strong>.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>The <strong>Debian GNU/Linux</strong> distribution was started by <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Murdock">Ian Murdock</a>
<em>(rip)</em> in August 1993. Everything started with a little, but
solid, group of <em>free software</em> hackers, which grew up to become
a large and well organized community of developers and end users.
<strong>Debian</strong> is now developed by a thousand of <a
href="https://www.debian.org/devel/people">volunteers</a> spread <a
href="https://www.debian.org/devel/developers.loc">around the
world</a>.</p>
<p>So, <strong>Debian</strong> is a <em>complete set of free
software</em>.<br />
A <strong>free software</strong> is defined by the 4 freedoms <a
href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html">https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html</a>:
it gives the end users the freedom of <strong>using</strong>,
<strong>studying</strong>, <strong>sharing</strong> and
<strong>modifying</strong> that software, without breaking the law. To
achieve this, it is necessary for the developer to distribute the source
code and authorize the end-user to exercise its rights granted by a
<strong>free license</strong>.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/peha/ian_murdock_20151230_by_peha.png"
alt="In memory of Ian Murdock by Péhä CC-0" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">In memory of Ian Murdock by Péhä
CC-0</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>One of the major interests of the free software is that it allows
skilled people to audit the program code, to insure notably that
<strong>it does only</strong> what it is supposed to do. So it is an
additional barrier <strong>to protect your privacy</strong> <img
src="img/smile/cool.png" />.</p>
<p>Debian implements this principle in its <a
href="https://www.debian.org/social_contract.en.html">Social
Contract</a>, and particularly in the <a
href="https://www.debian.org/social_contract.en.html#guidelines">Free
Software Guidelines</a> according to Debian. This contract states that
<strong>the Debian project will remain 100% free</strong>.</p>
<p>However the contract recognizes that some users might need “non-free”
components to run their systems, like some peripheral drivers, or some
applications decoding specific music or video files, for example. That’s
why the distributed software is divided into 4 sections:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>main</strong> for the free software packages available by
default,</li>
<li><strong>non-free-firmware</strong> for the non-free firmwares
available by default,</li>
<li><strong>contrib</strong> for the packages respecting the free
software guidelines by themselves, but which are depending on non-free
software, that do not comply with these guidelines,</li>
<li><strong>non-free</strong> for packages which do not comply with the
free software guidelines.</li>
</ul>
<p>Debian is developed very thoroughly. <strong>Every new stable
version</strong> is carefully tested by users before it is released. And
this release happens <em>when it is ready</em>. Hence <strong>few
maintenance work</strong> is required once the system is installed and
facing problems is very rare.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/logo/debian-txt-big.png" class="logo"
alt="logo Debian “debian”" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">logo Debian “debian”</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Like numerous other free distributions, Debian is not very sensitive
to malware (like viruses, Trojan horses, spyware…) and for several
reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>This large variety of software is available from
<strong>repositories</strong> hosted on <strong>servers controlled by
the project</strong>. Therefore, it is not necessary to search programs
to be installed on dubious sites which distribute viruses and unwanted
programs in addition to the one you were looking for.</li>
<li>The <em>administrator</em> and the <em>user</em> rights are clearly
separated, which helps a lot in limiting the damages: In case of a viral
infection, only the user’s documents are affected. This clear separation
of the rights limits also the risks of error made between the keyboard
and the chair. More details on the rights in <a
href="#rights-and-permissions">chapter 3.7</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="img/misc/chevalier.gif" /> <strong>The back-up</strong> of
you data on a regular basis remains the best insurance to protect them
against potential viruses or technical issues, but also against your own
mistakes (<a href="#back-up-your-data">chap.9</a>).</p>
<h2 data-number="1.2" id="where-to-find-help"><span
class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Where to find help</h2>
<p>Do you need help? The first reflex, if you can, is to consult the
documentation. Next come the various user’s forums, and then a GNU/Linux
Group (LUG), if you are lucky enough to be located nearby. There are
also several events dedicated to the free software in various
associations: you will be able to schedule appointments not far from
your home by consulting agendas of the Libre software <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_free-software_events">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_free-software_events</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>documentation embedded in the system</strong> itself: in
general, the installed applications include a manual available from the
command line (<a href="#the-terminal">chap.3.8</a>) by typing ‘man
application_name’ and/or from the graphical menu with the “Help” button
of the application.</li>
<li>The <strong>on-line documentation</strong>: when you use a GNU/Linux
distribution like Debian, you can access a detailed on-line
documentation, with a list of the functionalities of the embedded
applications. Debian provides you an official documentation: <a
href="https://wiki.debian.org">https://wiki.debian.org</a>.</li>
<li>Self-help and <strong>support forums</strong>: the free software
community is divided into a host of forums, sites and blogs of
information. Finding your way in this abundance of communication is
sometimes tricky, and you should rather prefer the sites dedicated to
your own environment or distribution. Concerning Debian, the main
self-help forum is available to support you: the Debian User forum (<a
href="https://forums.debian.net/">https://forums.debian.net/</a>). You
could get some extra information on the Debian Official Support page: <a
href="https://www.debian.org/support">https://www.debian.org/support</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Associations and LUGs</strong>: if you are lucky, you are
living not too far from a Linux users group or an association where
members meet on a regular basis. In this case don’t hesitate to pay them
a visit for a little chat (<a
href="https://tldp.org/HOWTO/User-Group-HOWTO-3.html">https://tldp.org/HOWTO/User-Group-HOWTO-3.html</a>).</li>

<h3 data-number="1.2.1" id="about-forums-geeks-and-the-terminal"><span
class="header-section-number">1.2.1</span> About forums, geeks, and the
terminal</h3>
<p>The self-help and support GNU/Linux community mainly consists of
<strong>passionate volunteers</strong> <img
src="img/logo/gnulinux.png" /> who share their knowledge with great
pleasure. They are also very technical persons, friendly called the
geeks (usually wearing a beard), with several years of computer practice
behind them. This experience leads them to master the
<strong>terminal</strong>, which is the most efficient tool to manage a
GNU/Linux system: therefore, the very first answers found on the forums
will naturally be given in the form of a set of command line operations.
Don’t be scared: in most of the cases a graphical solution (using the
mouse within a window) exists also. Ask kindly and you will get an
explanation.</p>
<p><strong>To be able to ask a question on a self-help and support
forum</strong> you should usually register first. You need a valid email
address to register with, then receive a confirmation request message
and, once registered, the notifications of the answers you got.</p>
<p><strong>Before you ask a question</strong>, please remember to look
first into the Questions/Answers already solved: most of the forum
include a search function by keyword, which will help you find out if
your problem is already described in there and has a documented
solution.</p>
<p>Don’t forget that a forum is usually maintained by
<strong>volunteers</strong>, not to be confused with a post-sales
customer service organization <img src="img/smile/wink.png" />.</p>

<p><strong>We begin here a scary page…</strong></p>
<p><strong>Let’s start with a simple statement: Software developers and
end-users do not speak the same language…</strong></p>
<figure>
<img src="img/02-info/01-dev-vs-user.jpg" alt="Dev vs users" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Dev vs users</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>But then … how are we going to make it?</strong></p>
<p>Easy: we read the beginner’s handbook! <img
src="img/smile/love.gif" /></p>
<p>Within a short period of time, computers became essential tools of
the modern life. One issue is that information and education don’t
follow the technical progress at the same pace, nor the needs of the
users.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is difficult for a “new user” to discover the full
capabilities of its computer. Moreover we use generally only few
applications.</p>
<p>We will try to simplify this universe as far as possible, in order
for you to make the most of your computer and to enjoy the capabilities
of Debian.</p>
<p><strong>How does a computer work ?</strong></p>
<p>One launches applications, clicks on icons, types some text in … One
needs a computer, a screen, a keyboard, a mouse.</p>
<p>In this handbook, we will show you the basic manipulations in order
to use your mouse and your keyboard.</p>
<p><strong>What use for a computer?</strong></p>
<p>It seems difficult to summarize in few sentences the whole scope of
the information technology field. However its usage is somewhat clear
:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>watch a movie</strong>: whether it is for your summer
vacation footage, or a DVD, or a video file downloaded from Internet,
Debian offers you several multimedia players. An example in this manual
with VLC (<a href="#watch-a-video">chap.6.7</a>).</li>
<li><strong>listen to music</strong>: enjoy your audio CD, your direct
radio streaming, or your digital music library with Rhythmbox (<a
href="#listen-to-music">chap.6.8</a>) and without any trouble.</li>
<li><strong>search for something on Internet</strong>: browse the Net,
visit pages, contribute to Internet, by using several Debian web
applications, let’s take Firefox as an example (<a
href="#navigate-on-internet">chap.6.6</a>).</li>
<li><strong>read or write electronic mails</strong>: communicate with
your family, your contacts, using either your email client or your web
browser (<a href="#retrieve-your-email-account">chap.6.4</a>).</li>
<li><strong>work on formatted documents or presentations</strong>:
Debian includes several applications, but the LibreOffice suite (<a
href="#work-with-word-processor">chap.6.9</a>) will let you perform all
kinds of office work using compatible formats.</li>
<li><strong>walk through your family pictures</strong>: your memories in
one click, simply using the image viewers integrated on all the Debian
desktop.</li>
<li><strong>print documents or images</strong>: Debian uses the CUPS
printing server, and its common configuration tool (<a
href="#universal-graphical-method-with-cups">chap.6.2.2</a>), but you
can also use an integrated utility for a simplified printer
configuration (<a
href="#simplified-graphical-method-with-system-config-printer">chap.6.2.1</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>And this is exactly the know-how you are going to acquire with
<strong>the beginner’s handbook</strong> <img
src="img/smile/cool.png" />.</p>
<h2 data-number="2.1" id="test-your-level-of-computer-skills"><span
class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Test your level of computer
skills</h2>
<p>Keep in mind that this manual is not cast in stone… Our advices are
only suggestions regarding your computer knowledge …</p>
<p><strong>First of all, you are free!</strong> <img
src="img/smile/big_smile.png" /></p>
<p>Importantly, be as honest as possible: we are all beginners in one
domain or another (personally, I am unable to change the injectors in
the carburetor of my car) and it is not a fault. The issue is raising
only because computers are taking a large space in our lives, and
penalize the newbies. But we are here to change all that!</p>
<p>The goal of this manual is not to transform you in <em>GNU/Linux
sysadmin</em> (short for system administrator), but simply give you the
tools to <strong>utilize your computer as you want</strong> !</p>
<p><strong>Outright beginner?</strong><br />
You never or rarely used a keyboard? You still wonder why you must “open
a window” and what is this “drag and drop” concept?</p>
<p>Please continue reading this manual and follow its guidance. You will
learn how to use your mouse and keyboard (the tools to directly
interface with the machine), and to recognize the basic elements of your
desktop environment (menus, panels, windows, virtual desktop …).<br />
Then discover Debian and its functionalities. <img
src="img/smile/cool.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Novice user?</strong><br />
You are a Windows® user and/or you have a little experience with
GNU/Linux, but you never installed it: it is the right time to choose
your flavor of Debian (<a href="#pick-your-debian">chap.4</a>) and
discover the interface of your future system.</p>
<p><strong>Basic user?</strong><br />
You have already used a Debian derivative and/or another free
distribution, and you know exactly what you need. Let’s jump directly to
the serious stuff with the actual installation (<a
href="#installing-debian">chap.5</a>).</p>
<h2 data-number="2.2" id="the-mouse"><span
class="header-section-number">2.2</span> The mouse</h2>
<p>The mouse is the <strong>physical interface</strong> which let you
move the <strong>pointer</strong> on the screen:<br />
the mouse <img src="img/mouse/mouse.png" /> moves are synchronized with
those of the little arrow (the pointer) <img
src="img/mouse/pointeur-default.png" /> on your desktop.<br />
There are different <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_mouse">types of mouse</a>;
we will take here the example of the classical mouse with two buttons
and a scrolling wheel.</p>
<h3 data-number="2.2.1" id="left-click-and-double-click"><span
class="header-section-number">2.2.1</span> Left-click and double-click
<img src="img/mouse/clic-gauche.png" /></h3>
<p>The <strong>left-click</strong> (or simple-click) is the most common
opearation and is used to <strong>point to</strong> (or select) either a
folder, or a file or an image, which can then be <strong>open</strong>
with a <strong>double-click</strong> (pressing twice the mouse
left-button). This left-click is also used to send commands to the
computer (by validating a choice) when one presses on the “button” or
something else sensitive to the click (i.e. the cross closing a
window).</p>
<h3 data-number="2.2.2" id="right-click"><span
class="header-section-number">2.2.2</span> Right-click <img
src="img/mouse/clic-droit.png" /></h3>
<p>The <strong>right-click</strong> is used to open a contextual menu (a
variable list of options, depending on the software used and the
“object” pointed at by the mouse) in order to modify a file, a folder, a
configuration …</p>
<h3 data-number="2.2.3" id="middle-click"><span
class="header-section-number">2.2.3</span> Middle-click <img
src="img/mouse/clic-central.png" /></h3>
<p>The <strong>middle-click</strong> or <strong>scrolling-wheel</strong>
is used for scrolling and quick copy. If your mouse has neither a middle
button nor a scrolling wheel, the “middle-click” can be emulated by
pressing on the two (left and right) buttons at the same time.</p>
<h3 data-number="2.2.4" id="actions-executed-with-the-mouse"><span
class="header-section-number">2.2.4</span> Actions executed with the
mouse</h3>
<p>The main action of the mouse is to point out an item to open it (in
the case of a document for example) or to launch it (in the case of a
link to an application or a menu entry). For that, nothing very
complicated, just place the pointer on the element and then double-click
with the left button of your mouse.</p>
<p>One thing that you <strong>SHOULD NEVER DO</strong> is to click
several times on a button if you think that nothing happens. It is very
possible that an application won’t start “immediately”, it is very
depending on your hardware and the application being launched. As an
example, a web browser takes significantly more time to start up, than
the file manager.</p>

<p>To graphically move or copy your data, it is enough to “drag” them
across the screen and “drop” them where you want (this is the graphical
equivalent of the <strong>mv</strong> command).</p>
<p>Example: to move a file you just downloaded into another folder,
press the left-button on the file in question, and while you hold the
left-button, you move the mouse into the destination folder and then you
release the mouse button:</p>

<h2 data-number="2.3" id="the-keyboard"><span
class="header-section-number">2.3</span> The keyboard</h2>
<p>The keyboard is <strong>the main physical interface to enter
data</strong> in your computer. But it is not just the device which let
you enter some words in the Internet search bar, or work with a word
processor.</p>
<p>It includes also some special keys, called <strong>modifier
keys</strong>, which allow you to execute quick actions by modifying the
behavior of the “normal” keys.</p>
<p>The combinations of some “special” keys with other “normal” keys form
the <strong>keyboard shortcuts</strong> (<a
href="#keyboard-shortcuts">chap.2.3.2</a>).</p>

<h3 data-number="2.3.1" id="the-modifier-keys"><span
class="header-section-number">2.3.1</span> The modifier keys</h3>
<p>The “non-alphanumeric” keys of the keyboard give you access to
extended functionalities during action or edition phases. From the
simple carriage return within a text editor with the [Enter] key, to the
launch of a Help window with the [F1] key, find hereafter some
descriptions of these special keys:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>[ENTER]</strong> The first “special” key, which is not
really a modifier key. This is the most important key of your keyboard
since it let you end a command line, launch a search request. Basically
this is the key saying “Yes” to the computer. When a dialog window opens
on the screen, either to confirm a download or delete an application,
take the time to read the message before pressing [Enter].</li>
<li><strong>[Ctrl]</strong> or <strong>[Control]</strong> Located at the
bottom of your keyboard, on both sides of the space bar, it is the
default key used for the shortcuts.</li>
<li><strong>[Alt]</strong> or <strong>[Function]</strong> By default
this key displays the specific shortcuts of an application. Within an
open window, pressing the [Alt] key reveals the shortcuts to navigate
through the menus or trigger some actions. These shortcut keys are
identified by an underscore.</li>
<li><strong>[AltGr]</strong> let you use the hidden characters of the
keyboard. More information in the dedicated section (<a
href="#special-characters">chap.2.3.3</a>).</li>
<li><strong>[Tab]</strong> or <strong>[Tabulation]</strong> Symbolized
by two opposite horizontal arrows. It allows you to complete a command
or navigate through the various fields of a form, or menus of a
window.</li>
<li><strong>[Shift]</strong> or <strong>[Uppercase]</strong> Key
symbolized by a wide up-arrow. let you type capitalized characters, and
sometimes numbers (depending on your keyboard layout), some special
characters like “@”,“%”, “&amp;” etc.</li>
<li><strong>[CapsLock]</strong> or <strong>[Capital Lock]</strong> Key
symbolized by a lock or a larger [Shift], causes all letters to be
generated in capitals until deactivated. Equivalent to a [Shift] key
down permanently.</li>
<li><strong>[ESC]</strong> or <strong>[Escape]</strong> This key cancels
the latest entry of a modifier, or closes a dialog box asking the user
to make a choice (equivalent to click on the “Cancel” button in the
dialog box).</li>
<li><strong>[F1]</strong>, <strong>[F2]</strong>…<strong>[F12]</strong>
Execute various functions… by definition. The [F1] key is often used to
launch the Help function within applications, [F11] to switch to
full-screen mode, for example.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Why bother?</em> <strong>Because it’s much faster!</strong> <img
src="img/smile/big_smile.png" /><br />
Note that the shortcuts are triggered by pressing down the keys
together, at the same time: to copy a selection, press and hold the
[Ctrl] key, then press the ‘c’ key. You can then release both keys, a
clone of your selection is stored in the “clipboard” (a special buffer
located in the memory of the operating system).<br />

Note that some functionalities are not only available on text segments
(like copy/paste), but on files also: if you select several pictures in
your ‘Pictures’ folder, make a [Ctrl]+‘c’ and then a [Ctrl]+‘v’ on your
desktop, your selected pictures will be copied there. In the same way,
[Ctrl]+mouse-scrolling-wheel will zoom in or out the content of your
Internet navigator, as well as the content of a file manager window.</p>

<p>The beginner’s handbook provide you a mouse and keyboard training
page.<br />
Right or left click, movement with the mouse, special characters,
keyboard selection … enough to get started with your keyboard and your
mouse quickly from a simple online interface:<br />
<a

<h2 data-number="2.5" id="the-users"><span
class="header-section-number">2.5</span> The users</h2>
<p>One of the great strengths of the GNU/Linux systems is their user
management. The separation of rights and responsibilities provides a
better security level when executing system administration tasks or
exchanging data on the net. Small explanation …</p>
<h3 data-number="2.5.1" id="user"><span
class="header-section-number">2.5.1</span> $USER</h3>
<p><img src="img/misc/icon-user.png#left" /> Generally YOU are the user,
of course. Sometimes one talks about the Chair-To-Keyboard interface
(abbreviated CTKI), since it’s very true that you are sitting between
the chair and the keyboard, or the mouse. When you work on your
computer, it does not see you. It feels only the actions made by a user
with a <em>login-name</em> and sometimes a <em>password</em>.</p>
<p>Each user is allowed to perform a certain number of actions. Your
user can, for example, use the keyboard and the mouse, read and write
some documents (files), but not all of them. We call that
<em>rights</em>: to execute administrative tasks, one must obtain the
<strong>root</strong> administrator rights (<a
href="#administrator-mode-example">chap.3.8.3</a>).</p>
<h3 data-number="2.5.2" id="root"><span
class="header-section-number">2.5.2</span> #ROOT</h3>
<p><img src="img/misc/icon-root.png#left" /> Only one user has all the
rights, it is the <em>administrator</em>. This special user is able to
execute some tasks (in particular for the system administration) that
other <em>normal</em> users cannot perform by themselves. But a single
mistake in an operation made by this <em>root</em> user could
potentially break the whole system.</p>
<p>At home, on your desktop computer, you can use your system both as a
<em>normal user</em> and as an <em>administrator</em>. Some well defined
actions have to take place in order to switch from one role to the
other, like typing the root administrator password (<a
href="#administrator-mode-example">chap.3.8.3</a>).</p>
<h3 data-number="2.5.3" id="separate-to-secure"><span
class="header-section-number">2.5.3</span> Separate to secure</h3>
<p><img src="img/misc/icon-chose.png#left" /> This clean distinction,
which, by the way, does not always exist under other operating systems,
strengthens the stability and security of the Debian GNU/Linux system,
as mentioned at the beginning of this manual. When working as
<em>simple/normal</em> user you cannot make your computer unusable
(brick it), and the potential viruses cannot infect the whole
system.</p>
<p><strong>More details on rights and permissions in the <a
href="#rights-and-permissions">chapter 3.7</a>.</strong></p>
<h1 data-number="3" id="the-graphical-environment"><span
class="header-section-number">3</span> <img
src="img/nav42/desktop.png" /> The graphical environment</h1>
<p><strong>Let’s start by looking at the various elements displayed on
the screen.</strong> On this simple image, you can already identify the
first elements which are explained below in this handbook:</p>

</figure>
<p><strong>The “panel” or task bar</strong> (at the bottom of the
screen, in this example, but it can be moved wherever you wish) which
could include the “application menu” listing your installed software, a
collection of launchers (small icons) for your favorite applications,
the list of the currently open windows, the time, the notification
area…</p>
<p><strong>A file manager window</strong> which displays the folders
contained in your home directory.</p>
<p>You will discover other interfaces and layouts in the chapter
dedicated to desktop environments (<a
href="#choosing-your-gnulinux-desktop">chap.4.2</a>).</p>
<h2 data-number="3.1" id="the-task-bar"><span
class="header-section-number">3.1</span> The task bar</h2>
<p>The “panel”, the task bar, the notification area… all these words to
talk about the information and launcher interface of your system.</p>
<p>Usually, it is a banner located at the top or the bottom of your
screen, displaying several types of information, launchers, menus to
quickly access your data or your applications, but also informing you
(new email has arrived, what time it is, a USB disk was just plugged
in…) via the notification area.</p>
<p>Here after a quick overview of the various “panels” on the Debian
desktops: Gnome, Xfce, LXDE, MATE, Cinnamon, KDE and LXQt:</p>

</figure>
<p>Irrelevant of the type of desktop, the task bar displays, at least,
the following elements:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>An application menu</strong>, letting you have access to the
installed software tools. In general, the applications are sorted and
grouped by categories (Multimedia, Office…) and are launched by a
left-click on their labels or icons.</li>
<li><strong>A list of active windows</strong> or at least the title of
the active windows. Depending on the context, a left click on the
corresponding button will minimize, restore or bring to the foreground
the target application.</li>
<li><strong>The time with the date</strong> also displayed when the
cursor hovers on the area. On some desktops an agenda is open by a
left-click on the time.</li>
<li><strong>A notification area</strong> with more or less information,
depending on the desktop, intended to display messages coming from your
applications (new email, network connection …).</li>
<li><strong>An action button</strong> to quit the working session, to
suspend, stop or restart your computer. Depending on your configuration
you might switch user, with this button, and take advantage of the
multi-user mode of the Debian GNU/Linux systems.</li>
</ul>
<p>Like almost all the elements of the GNU/Linux desktops, the task bar
can be configured and embellished by plug-ins (little specialized
modules) or simply removed <img src="img/smile/wink.png" /> !</p>
<p>A right-click on the “panel” opens a drop down menu allowing you to
change its configuration (except for the Gnome-3 desktop). Hereafter an
example of configuration for the Xfce panel:</p>

<h2 data-number="3.2" id="menus"><span
class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Menus</h2>
<p>The various applications installed in your system are available
through several vectors: launchers on the desktop, or in the task bars,
and more generally using the <strong>menus</strong>.</p>
<p>In the menus, your programs are <strong>listed and sorted by
categories</strong>. A left-click on the menu icon displays the
application and section entries. A left-click on a program icon launches
the corresponding application. Each desktop has its own specific
menu:</p>

<p>Your applications, your data, your USB keys, are usually displayed
within a decorated frame. Each desktop environment decorates windows its
own way, but most of the times they implement the same functions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>the title bar</strong> at the top displays the window title
and the action buttons (minimize/maximize/close),</li>
<li><strong>the decorations</strong> around the window, which include
two areas at the bottom to resize the window using a mouse
left-click,</li>
<li><strong>the status area</strong>: some applications display
informations at the bottom of the window (like free space available in
the active partition, size of the file currently pointed at …).</li>
</ul>
<p>Actions on windows are possible with the keyboard: either directly
with a function key, or by using a keyboard shortcut (<a
href="#keyboard-shortcuts">chap.2.3.2</a>), but generally your mouse
will do the job. <img src="img/mouse/mouse-mini.png" /></p>

from <img src="img/mouse/pointeur-default.png" /> to <img
src="img/mouse/pointeur-bl.png" /> or <img
src="img/mouse/pointeur-br.png" /> depending on its left or right
position. When the look of the pointer changes, press the left-button
and move the mouse to resize the window like you want.</p>
<p>An alternative solution consists in using the special [Alt] key on
your keyboard. Move the pointer inside the window, then press together
the [Alt] key and the right-button of the mouse. Then you will be able
to resize the window.</p>
<p><strong>To maximize the window</strong>, double-click (click twice
quickly with the mouse left-button) on the title-bar (when using the
GNOME environment) or use the maximize button located next to the close
button, if present (and it is the case on most of the desktops).</p>
<h2 data-number="3.4" id="virtual-desktops"><span
class="header-section-number">3.4</span> Virtual desktops</h2>
<p>To avoid overloading your workspace, the Debian GNU/Linux
environments support, since several years, the virtual desktop concept:
the elements displayed on your screen lay upon a “desktop”. You can have
several of them, which means that if you move to another “desktop”, it
will be empty at first. If you return back to the previous desktop, you
will find it in the same state as when you left it (with your open
applications on screen).</p>
<p><img src="img/misc/noob-info.png#left" /><br />
<strong>… “Several desktops” … What do you mean exactly
??</strong><br />
Well, it’s like having <strong>several screens</strong> for your
computer, lined up <strong>behind each other</strong>, with the
capability to change their order at will.</p>
<p>You open the Internet navigator full screen on the first virtual
desktop, then you feel like having a look at your latest family
pictures. So you <strong>go to the next desktop</strong> which happens
to be empty, and you can then display there your pictures also in full
screen mode, and return back to the first desktop and enjoy the full
real estate for the comfort of your navigation.<br />
It is also a nice mean to get <strong>organized with your
tasks</strong>: the first desktop is reserved for the Internet
applications, the second for the multimedia, the third for the office
work and so on, allowing you to leave open your work in progress, for
future modifications, without impacting the other activities.</p>
<p>Each environment has its own way to represent the virtual
desktops:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gnome</strong> displays shrunk desktops under the search
box:</li>

<h2 data-number="3.5" id="file-management-on-gnulinux"><span
class="header-section-number">3.5</span> File management on
GNU/Linux</h2>
<p>All your data, your videos, your documents, your pictures, are
regarded by Debian GNU/Linux as files, and these files are organized
into folders.<br />
Debian is an operating system (the big piece of software making your
computer functional) which organizes the data according to their
respective addresses, that is the path to follow, in order to access
them, from the top level starting point (the system root identified by
the “/” symbol).</p>
<p><img src="img/misc/noob-info.png#left" /><br />
<strong>… the picture of grandma is a “file” having an “address”
relative to a “root” ???</strong><br />
Imagine your computer is like your house. If your favorite book is
located in a certain place, this “place” is like an address relative to
the “house”. For example, if the book is stored in the second drawer of
your nightstand, one can define its address (the path to follow in order
to reach it) like this: home,bedroom,nightstand,2nd drawer,favorite
book.<br />
To separate the various “items” we use the “/” symbol, which gives the
following address in computer language: /home/bedroom/nightstand/2nd
drawer/favorite book.<br />
The “root” of the system is symbolized by a simple “/”. The main folder
containing all the users data is symbolized by “/home/”, and your
personal folder is named “/home/alice/”.<br />
If we come back to the favorite book example, its address could
be:<br />
“/home/alice/Documents/books/my_favorite_book.pdf”</p>

</figure>
<p>Your personal data are stored within your <em>personal folder</em>,
whose address is “/home/your_user_name”. They are organized within
folders to ease the finding and consulting of the various files, by
yourself or by some programs (it is very logical for a photo viewer to
look first at the “Pictures” folder).</p>
<h3 data-number="3.5.2" id="your-hidden-files"><span
class="header-section-number">3.5.2</span> Your hidden files</h3>
<p>Some items within your personal folder, relate to your interface
configuration, the various fonts you are using, your passwords stored in
Firefox, etc.<br />
This type of data does not need to be always displayed on the screen
when you consult your photos or documents: this is why these items are
usually <em>hidden</em>.</p>
<p>They are identified by the form “/home/your_user_name/.hidden_file”.
Please note the “<strong>.</strong>” (dot) symbol in front of the file
name.<br />
When you want to unveil them, press together [Ctrl]+‘h’ (h obviously for
“hidden”), or from the menu of your file manager window goto “View” &gt;

<h3 data-number="3.5.3" id="the-file-system"><span
class="header-section-number">3.5.3</span> The file system</h3>
<p>Debian GNU/Linux includes a collection of programs to navigate on the
Internet, or inside your personal folder, or among all your photo
albums, etc. These programs are stored inside “system folders”.</p>
<p>These folders are write-protected and some are also read-protected:
this means that you can consult some of them, but you may not modify any
of them, as being a simple user.<br />
In order to modify these items, you need to use the system administrator
account: “root” (<a
href="#administrator-mode-example">chap.3.8.3</a>).</p>
<h2 data-number="3.6" id="an-example-of-file-manager-thunar"><span
class="header-section-number">3.6</span> An example of file manager:
Thunar</h2>
<p><img src="img/apps/thunar.png#left" /><br />
<strong>Thunar</strong> is the file manager by default with the
<strong>Xfce</strong> desktop. This program lets you navigate through
your various folders, “Pictures”, “Documents”, etc. by using the mouse
(double-click on a folder to look into its content) or the keyboard
(navigate among the folders with the arrows keys, and press [Enter] to
open the selected one).<br />
The role of a file manager is to display on screen the content of these
folders: your personal data. Thunar is accessible from the Xfce
application menu in the task bar, under the name “file manager”.</p>
<p>Each GNU/Linux desktop environment has its dedicated file manager
(otherwise it’s not funny) that has a slightly different interface than
Thunar. However, they all support the same functions of consultation,
search and modification of the data.</p>
<h3 data-number="3.6.1" id="simplified-presentation-of-thunar"><span
class="header-section-number">3.6.1</span> Simplified presentation of

<p>When Thunar displays your personal folder, a number of information
and tools are already available:</p>

</figure>
<ul>
<li><strong>#1 The title bar</strong>: displays the folder being viewed
and the program which was launched. It includes the “action buttons”
allowing you, with a mouse left-click, to minimize the window (then it
will be parked in the task bar), to maximize the window (it will occupy
the full screen), to close the window or any other actions available
with the window manager in use.</li>
<li><strong>#2 The menu bar</strong>: each menu gives you the
possibility to act on items (copy/paste/delete/rename, etc.), to change
the location, the view style (Icons, Detailed List, Compact List), and
even to close the window, always with a left-click. If the menu bar is
hidden, you can display it with the shortcut “Ctrl”+“m”.</li>
<li><strong>#3 The location bar</strong>: tells you which folder you are
currently in, and, if there is enough room, the latest visited
folder(s).</li>
<li><strong>#4 The tab bar</strong>: tells you which folders are open in
the active windows. Thunar tabs operate like those in your Internet
navigator.</li>
<li><strong>#5 The side pane</strong>: displays the main folders
(personal folder, wastebasket, file system, desktop), your shortcuts
(favorite folders) and the external volumes (USB keys or hard disk
drives plugged as USB devices). A left-click on the label will display
the selected folder. A middle-click will open the folder in a new tab
(handy to copy or move data). The side pane can also display the tree
structure of your system, that is the complete set of your folders and
files sorted hierarchically. You can mask/display the side pane with the
keyboard shortcut [Ctrl]+‘b’.</li>
<li><strong>#6 The main pane</strong>: displays the folder content. If
this folder includes other folders, they are positioned before the
“simple” files (like photos, PDF documents, etc.) and, by default,
sorted by alphabetic order (you can change the sort type from the menu
&gt; View &gt; “sort by”).</li>
<li><strong>#7 The status bar</strong>: displays the number of items in
the concerned folder, and the free remaining space in the current file
system, or indicates if one or several items are selected.</li>
</ul>
<h3 data-number="3.6.2" id="usage-and-functionality-of-thunar"><span
class="header-section-number">3.6.2</span> Usage and functionality of
Thunar</h3>
<p>Thunar will let you consult your data, sort them, and modify
them.</p>
<p>Note that other file managers have a different look and feel (GTK3),
like placing the application menu directly in the title bar like Gnome
for example (<a href="#gnome">chap.4.2.1</a>).</p>
<h4 data-number="3.6.2.1" id="consulting-your-data"><span
class="header-section-number">3.6.2.1</span> Consulting your data</h4>
<p>Consulting your data is very easy. Launch Thunar which, by default,
opens your personal folder. You can then decide to open another specific
folder depending on the type of data you are looking for.</p>
<p><strong>To open or explore a folder</strong>, put the mouse pointer
over it: a double-click with the left button will open this folder in
the same window. A middle-click will open the folder in a new window
tab.</p>
<p>You can also click on the shortcuts located in the left side pane of
the Thunar window.</p>
<p><strong>To open a file</strong>, put the mouse pointer over it: a
double-click with the left button will open this file with the
application assigned to it by default. A right-click will display a
contextual menu which, among other things, allows you to open the file
with another application of your choice.</p>
<h4 data-number="3.6.2.2" id="data-selection"><span
class="header-section-number">3.6.2.2</span> Data selection</h4>
<p>To select several items move the mouse cursor in an empty area of the
window, left-click,hold and simply move over all the items that you want
selected. Then release the button.</p>
<p>After this, you can remove one or several items from the selection
using the shortcut [Ctrl]+left-click on each of them.<br />
More details in the simplified initiation (<a
href="#selection-of-several-items">chap.2.2.4.2</a>).</p>
<p>Once selected, you can apply some modifications to these items as
detailed in the “Modifications” chapter below.</p>
<h4 data-number="3.6.2.3" id="classifying-the-data"><span
class="header-section-number">3.6.2.3</span> Classifying the data</h4>
<p>You are going to say: <em>I can do whatever I want with my own
data</em></p>
<p>… and <strong>you are damn right</strong> <img
src="img/smile/big_smile.png" /> !<br />
However some applications will access your data more easily if they are
stored in their specific folders. Thus, the screen capture program will
record its shots in the “Pictures” folder, the Internet navigator will
store your downloaded files in the “Downloads” folder, the music player
will look into the “Music” folder … And so on.</p>
<p><strong>Thunar</strong> allows you to create shortcuts to ease the
access, the classification and thus the retrieving of your data.
<strong>To create a shortcut</strong>, just “drag and drop” the desired
folder in the side pane. This folder will then be always accessible with
a simple click.</p>
<h4 data-number="3.6.2.4"
id="data-modification-using-the-contextual-menu"><span
class="header-section-number">3.6.2.4</span> Data modification using the
contextual menu</h4>
<p>A contextual menu shows up when right-clicking on an item (I.E.
either a folder or a file), and then, let you make a number of
actions/modifications on this selected item.<br />
Note that if you selected several items, modifications will then be
applied to the whole selection.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/03-gui/21-thunar-contextuel.jpg"
alt="Contextual menu in Thunar" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Contextual menu in Thunar</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In our example the contextual menu proposes the following
actions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Open with the default application</strong>, here the
Ristretto image viewer.</li>
<li><strong>Open with</strong> another application: if you choose this
option, another window will open and let you navigate in the system to
select a different application (start searching in
/usr/bin/‘app-name’).</li>
<li><strong>Send To</strong> is a menu to share this item via email, or
create a link on the desktop, or other different actions depending on
the type of item selected.</li>
<li><strong>Cut</strong>: this action will <strong>remove</strong> the
selected item with the goal of <strong>pasting</strong> it somewhere
else. It is then enough to navigate into the <strong>destination
folder</strong>, to make a right-click on an empty area of the window
and to pick the “<strong>Paste</strong>” action in the menu.</li>
<li><strong>Copy</strong>: this action leaves the selected item in its
original folder, but let you copy (clone) it into the destination
folder, following the same procedure as the one described in the “Cut”
action above.</li>
<li><strong>Move to Wastebasket</strong>: this action
<strong>removes</strong> the selected item from its parent folder and
move it directly into the Trash Bin (see next chapter).</li>
<li><strong>Rename</strong>: this action let you modify the name of the
selected item.</li>
<li><strong>Set as wallpaper</strong>: is rather explicit and appears
only if a image type file is selected.</li>
<li><strong>Create Archive</strong>: this action allows you to compress
one or several selected item(s). In the window that opens, you can
choose the destination folder, by navigating in the side pane, enter a
name for this archive and select its type. Then click on the “New”
button to start the archive process.</li>
<li><strong>Properties</strong>: this action let you modify the name of
a file, the default application when you open it, assign an “emblem” (or
tag) to it or manage the access rights and “Permissions” of the selected
item.</li>
</ul>
<h4 data-number="3.6.2.5" id="data-removal"><span
class="header-section-number">3.6.2.5</span> Data removal</h4>
<p>The famous “Trash bin” (or “Wastebasket”) is reachable directly from
the side pane of the Thunar window. The “full bin” icon indicates that
some items are currently in the wastebasket.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/03-gui/22-corbeille.jpg"
alt="Empty the Wastebasket using the sidebar icon" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Empty the Wastebasket using the sidebar
icon</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>To empty the Wastebasket</strong> and remove definitively all
the items in there, left-click on its proper icon and select the “Empty
Wastebasket” action. You can also use the “File” menu and then click on
“Empty Wastebasket”.</p>
<p>Sometimes the context menu has the “Delete” entry. Be careful because
this menu entry will not move your files to the recycle bin: they will
be deleted immediately and definitively.</p>
<h2 data-number="3.7" id="rights-and-permissions"><span
class="header-section-number">3.7</span> Rights and permissions</h2>
<p>Debian is a <strong>multi-user</strong> GNU/Linux system. It is
therefore necessary to put in place a mechanism to protect the items
belonging to each user, so that user <em>alice</em> could not modify the
“tax &amp; due” list of user <em>arp</em>, for example.</p>
<p>To achieve this goal, each file and each folder belongs to one
<em>owner</em> and to one <em>users group</em>.</p>
<p>For each item, one can give <strong>R</strong>ead,
<strong>W</strong>rite and e<strong>X</strong>ecute rights distinctly to
its owner, its group or all the others (I.E. persons which are neither
the owner nor a member of the proprietary group).</p>
<p>To display these information, one can use the “ls” (<em>list
directory content</em>) command, with the option “-l”, within a terminal
window (that you will discover in the next chapter):</p>
<pre><code>ls -l
-rw-r----- 1 arp money  1794 Nov 20 14:46 tax-and-due.txt</code></pre>
<p>Here, one can see that the user <em>arp</em> has the
“<strong>r</strong>ead” and “<strong>w</strong>rite” rights, on the file
‘tax-and-due.txt’, while the members of the <em>money</em> group (which
user <em>alice</em> is part of) can only “<strong>r</strong>ead” this
file, but not modify it, and the others cannot even open it
(“<strong>-</strong>”, means no right).</p>

<p>The file managers integrated in the various Debian desktops let you
also display and/or modify the rights and permissions of your system
folders and files “with the mouse only”. To do so, you need to open the
contextual menu with a right-click on the file/folder you are interested
in, and click on “Properties”. In the new window which opens, click on
the “Permissions” tab:</p>

<h2 data-number="3.8" id="the-terminal"><span

<p><img src="img/apps/terminal.png#left" /><br />
When you launch an application from the menu, or when you move a file
from a folder to another by using your mouse, you send instructions to
your computer in graphical mode.</p>
<p>These instructions can also be sent directly, without going trough a
menu or launching an application, thanks to the
<strong>Terminal</strong> which gives you access to <strong>the command
line</strong>. This tool is more powerful than the graphical interface
because it let you use all the options available in your application. It
is also your last resort when the graphical session is gone.</p>
<p>The only concern is that this little black box, full of strange
signs, is somewhat frightening … But we are going to demystify all this
and show you that the terminal can become your new friend <img
src="img/smile/smile.png" />.</p>
<p>In case of doubts, don’t hesitate to ask your questions in the
support and help forums (<a

<p><img src="img/misc/warning.png#left" /><br />
<strong>Never run terminal tests in administrator mode !!</strong> :
some very useful commands like “rm”
(<strong>r</strong>e<strong>m</strong>ove) allow you to bypass the
“wastebasket” principle, but could be devastating on the entire system
when you are running them in administrator mode.</p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Terminal presentation</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Let’s simply start with what you see written in this terminal
window:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>the user</strong>, its you, or more exactly the one who is
logged in and uses the terminal</li>
<li><strong>the host name</strong>, is the name of the machine on your
local network, a name you did enter during the system installation</li>
<li><strong>the path</strong>, is the place where you are currently
located in the file system (here the personal folder ‘/home/arp/’
symbolized by the tilde “~”)</li>
<li><strong>the prompt delimiter</strong>, (symbolized here by the “$”
sign) after which you will type the command line. Its output (or “feed
back”) will be displayed on the following line(s) of the terminal.</li>
</ul>
<p>The configuration of the full prompt string resides in the
‘~/.bashrc’ (hidden file in your personal folder) “bash” interpreter
configuration file. The bash program is handling the commands entered in
the terminal (to make a long story short); it enables you to send
commands, typed in the terminal, to the computer system in order to give
it various instructions or obtain some information back. Please note
that you can also customize the Terminal display with the menu “Edit
&gt; Preference”.</p>
<h3 data-number="3.8.2" id="user-mode-example"><span
class="header-section-number">3.8.2</span> User mode example</h3>
<p>To tame the beast, we are going to start with a simple “cd” (standing
for “<strong>c</strong>hange <strong>d</strong>irectory”), which let you
walk through the file system.</p>
<p>When you open a Terminal, you are located by default in the personal
folder of the user logged-in (here it is the /home/arp/ $HOME folder).
This folder includes the sub-folders Pictures, Downloads, etc.</p>
<p>To go down into the ‘Pictures’ sub-folder, I type in the words “cd
Pictures” - without the quotes - (and the uppercase is of importance
here, hence the necessity to clearly identify the item names one is
looking at…) then I press [Enter] to <em>send</em> the command. To reach
this ‘Pictures’ folder from anywhere in the file system, you would need
to provide its full path ‘/home/arp/Pictures’ (replace ‘arp’ by your
user name):</p>
<pre><code>arp@debian:~$ cd /home/arp/Pictures
arp@debian:~/Pictures$</code></pre>
<p>You can see here that, within the command prompt prefix, the path
“<strong>~</strong>” has been changed to “<strong>~/Pictures</strong>”,
because you changed the folder you were in, and this is exactly like
opening a folder by using your graphical file manager.</p>
<p>However, when you open a folder with the file manager, you “see” all
the items in there. Within a terminal you need to list the items with
the “ls” command:</p>
<pre><code>arp@debian:~/Pictures$ ls
anonymous.png
carnaval.jpg
school-festival-01.jpg
school-festival-02.jpg
school-festival-03.jpg
wallpaper.png</code></pre>
<p>… easy, isn’t it ? See, you did not break anything. Yes, but you are
going to tell me that this stuff is rather useless…</p>
<p>OK, lets move on to cooler commands:</p>
<p>‘<strong>uname -r</strong>’ gives the version of the active Linux
kernel:</p>
<pre><code>arp@debian:~/Pictures$ uname -r
6.1.0-25-amd64
arp@debian:~/Pictures$</code></pre>
<p>‘<strong>uptime</strong>’ gives the elapsed time, since the system is
up and running, how many users are currently logged in, the system load
average for the past 1, 5, 15 minutes, in order to see if the process
waiting list is not too long. If the load is over 1 (for old computers)
or 2 (for dual-cores and +) this means that one process is running while
another one is waiting.</p>
<pre><code>arp@debian:~/Pictures$ uptime
 16:16:50 up  8:12,  1 user,  load average: 0,01, 0,13, 0,49
arp@debian:~/Pictures$</code></pre>
<p>You want to return back in your personal folder ? Just a small and
simple ‘<strong>cd</strong>’ and you are <span class="citation"
data-cites="home">@home</span>:</p>
<pre><code>arp@debian:~/Pictures$ cd
arp@debian:~$</code></pre>
<p>Your screen is a bit crowded ? A small ‘<strong>clear</strong>’ will
empty the console:</p>
<pre><code>arp@debian:~/Pictures$ cd
arp@debian:~$ clear</code></pre>
<h3 data-number="3.8.3" id="administrator-mode-example"><span
class="header-section-number">3.8.3</span> Administrator mode
example</h3>
<p>On a GNU/Linux system, an <strong>administrator</strong> is a user
who has the right to manage the system, install or remove applications
and modify “normal” user accounts (among other tasks). You can get
administrator rights via the “<strong>root</strong>” account or
substitute yourself to it thanks to “<strong>sudo</strong>”.</p>
<h4 data-number="3.8.3.1" id="root-and-user"><span
class="header-section-number">3.8.3.1</span> “root” and “user”</h4>
<p>If the Debian installation was done by creating <strong>both “root”
superuser and “normal” user account</strong> (for a regular system
usage), to place an order in administrator mode when the session was
opened as a “normal” user, Debian uses the “<strong>su -</strong>”
command. You are then asked to enter the superuser password, nothing is
displayed on the screen when typing the password in, this is normal.</p>
<p>Example: Debian system opened by the “normal” user: “user”</p>
<pre><code>user@debian-pc:~$ su -
Password:
root@debian-pc:~# apt update</code></pre>
<p>You note that the “<strong>$</strong>” sign (the command prompt
delimiter), as been replaced by the “<strong>#</strong>” sign,
indicating that you are now using the “<strong>root</strong>”
administrator account.</p>
<p>Once connected as “root” in the terminal session, you can launch
system administration commands, for example here, a package repository
update within a Gnome terminal, using the command “apt update”.</p>
<h4 data-number="3.8.3.2" id="user-without-root"><span
class="header-section-number">3.8.3.2</span> “user” without “root”</h4>
<p>If the Debian installation was done with the <strong>superuser
account disabled</strong> (the root password was left empty during the
installation process), the “normal” user is able to gain the superuser
privilege by using the “sudo” command. When using sudo you will be asked
to enter <strong>your own password</strong>.</p>
<p>Looking for update example:</p>
<pre><code>user@debian-pc:~$ sudo apt update

<p>Look again at this package list update example, that is the retrieval
of the latest information concerning packages and potential updates.
After the completion of this package list update (verifying the
repositories), we launch “sudo apt upgrade” to execute the available
updates for the software you have installed. This is what you will see
in your terminal window:</p>

<p>On Gnu/Linux, when a process must modify the system, it usually asks
you for a confirmation. Here the terminal informs you about the various
types of expected changes and wait for your agreement, either by simply
pressing [Enter] if you accept the default option (here “Yes”) or by
typing “y” to accept or “n” to decline.</p>

You must be extremely strict when you send commands in

feature. This mechanism allows the computer to complete the commands you
started typing (3 characters are enough), or their corresponding
arguments. This is accomplished by pressing on the [Tab] key. If several
choices are possible, they will be proposed to you as well.</p>
<p>A short summary of the GNU/Linux commands is proposed at the end of

<p>Debian is an operating system offered in several flavors, and you
will need to make a choice depending on your tastes, your needs and your
hardware.</p>
<h3 data-number="4.0.1" id="choosing-a-debian-derivative"><span
class="header-section-number">4.0.1</span> Choosing a Debian
derivative?</h3>
<p>There are a lot of Debian derivatives out there, more or less stable
and/or supported (Linux Mint Debian Edition, AntiX, MXLinux, etc…). This
manual and the indications in there can be used for all the Debian
Stable “Bookworm” derivatives.</p>
<p><img src="img/misc/noob-info.png#left" /><br />
The GNU/Linux distributions are not all supported by a community the
same way Debian is. Sometime, a single person handle the entire
distribution. The different distributions do not provide the same level
of documentation and support. They also do not offer the same
durability. Choosing a “mother” distribution like Debian insures you to
receive stable and regular updates.<br />
If you want to test other distributions based on Debian, we suggest you
consult the Debian derivatives official page (<a
href="https://wiki.debian.org/Derivatives/CensusFull">https://wiki.debian.org/Derivatives/CensusFull</a>).
If you want to consult a more comprehensive list, visit <a

Other projects develop systems for beginners in the GNU/Linux world. If
you want to try another system, let’s take a look at the GNU/Linux
distributions dedicated chapter in the Software Directory (<a

class="header-section-number">4.0.3</span> You want to try the Debian
journey <img src="img/logo/debian-mini.png" /></h3>
<p>Let’s go ! The rest of this manual will help you to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>choose the processor architecture</strong> (<a
href="#choosing-the-architecture">chap.4.1</a>),</li>
<li><strong>choose your main interface</strong> (<a
href="#choosing-your-gnulinux-desktop">chap.4.2</a>),</li>
<li><strong>launch the installation</strong> (<a
href="#installing-debian">chap.5</a>).</li>
</ul>
<h2 data-number="4.1" id="choosing-the-architecture"><span
class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Choosing the architecture</h2>
<p><strong>The processor</strong>, which is the compute and control unit
of your computer, functions under a specific type of architecture, that
is it handles data according to its own type (32 or 64 bits, PowerPC
…).</p>
<p>We encourage you to use an ISO image of type
“<strong>netinst</strong>” (<a href="#debian-netinst">chap.5.2.1.1</a>),
which gives you access to the most up-to-date software versions by
downloading directly the applications during the installation process
(you need an active and stable Internet connection during the install).
This version will let you install the desktop of your choice.<br />
You can also use an ISO image already including a ready-to-use
environment (Gnome, KDE, Xfce …).</p>
<p>But you must choose an ISO corresponding to your processor
architecture. In other words, decide between a 32-bit or a 64-bit
version, or again between an i386 or an amd64 version.<br />
Note that the “32-bit” version will run on a “64-bit” computer, but not
vice-versa.</p>
<h3 data-number="4.1.1" id="to-make-it-easy"><span
class="header-section-number">4.1.1</span> To make it easy</h3>
<ul>
<li>If your computer has a sticker indicating “coreDuo”, “core2duo”, or
was built after the year 2005, you can take an “amd64” ISO.</li>
<li>If your computer proudly displays the sign “Pentium IV M” or was
born before 2003, take an “i386” version.</li>
<li>In case of doubts, you can take the 32-bit “i386” version, it
functions everywhere.</li>
<li>In case of a huge doubt, ask the question on a forum (<a
href="#where-to-find-help">chap.1.2</a>).</li>
</ul>
<h3 data-number="4.1.2" id="checking-the-architecture"><span
class="header-section-number">4.1.2</span> Checking the
architecture</h3>
<p><strong>Using a GNU/Linux distribution</strong> in an autonomous
“live” session (<a
href="#testing-debian-in-live-session">chap.5.3.1</a>), open a terminal,
and in order to find out the 32 or 64 bits compatibility, type the
following command:</p>
<pre><code>lscpu | grep -i &quot;mode(s)&quot;</code></pre>
<p>which returns the explicit result, here an example when using an
‘amd64’ processor:</p>
<pre><code>CPU op-mode(s): 32-bit, 64-bit</code></pre>
<p><strong>Using a Windows</strong>® system, your processor model is
displayed in the “General” tab of the menu Start Button &gt;
Configuration Panel &gt; System. It is then necessary to carry out a
research on Internet to check if this processor is compatible with a
64-bit system.</p>
<h2 data-number="4.2" id="choosing-your-gnulinux-desktop"><span
class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Choosing your GNU/Linux
desktop</h2>
<p>Debian let you adopt one or several desktop environments directly
from the installer interface: <a href="#gnome">Gnome</a>, <a
href="#gnome-flashback">Gnome Flashback</a>, <a href="#kde">KDE</a>, <a
href="#mate">Mate</a>, <a href="#cinnamon">Cinnamon</a>, <a
href="#xfce">Xfce</a>, <a href="#lxdeopenbox">LXDE</a> and <a
href="#lxqt">LXQt</a>.</p>
<p><img src="img/misc/noob-info.png#left" /><br />
<strong>… But why several Gnu/Linux “desktops” ?</strong><br />
<strong>The computer is only a tool</strong>, and even if we ask you
sometime to learn a couple of tricks to make an effective use of it, it
is still <strong>your tool</strong>, and as such it must be highly
adaptable to your taste, your working habit, and to your own way to have
fun.</p>
<p>With this perspective, each desktop has its own organization, its
setting method, its various functionalities. And it is not a superfluous
diversity, designed by the brain mazes of some bearded geeks
(although…), but rather a strength of the <strong>free
software</strong>: knowing how <strong>to propose rather than to
impose!</strong> <img src="img/smile/cool.png" /></p>
<p>Hereafter the description of the main characteristics of this various
environments, to help you decide which one to use. And then you will be
able to add more of them, according to your needs and preferences.<br />
The two main desktops are Gnome and KDE, but they are also the more
“resource-hungry” solutions, so don’t hesitate to test other
environments.</p>
<p><strong>– Integrated applications –</strong></p>
<p>Each desktop environment is designed to offer a minimal functionality
for the personal usage of your computer.<br />
So, within all the desktops presented here, you will find the Firefox
Internet browser (<a href="#navigate-on-internet">chap.6.6</a>), a file
system manager, a text editor, the LibreOffice suite (<a
href="#work-with-word-processor">chap.6.9</a>), a multimedia player
(except on MATE DE, but it’s easy to add one) and an access to a
software library in order to maintain, update or make changes in your
installation.</p>

<p>The Gnome-Shell interface is the default desktop for Debian 12
“Bookworm” and offers:</p>
<p><strong>The Activities Overview</strong>, which is a separate view
designed to enable users to get an overview of their current activities
and to enable effective focus switching. It can be accessed via the
activities button at the left of the top bar or by pressing the “Win”
key of the keyboard. This view includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A series of application launchers (that you can easily add or remove
using the drag and drop method, or by using a right-click on the
“dock”).</li>
<li>All the open applications.</li>
<li>The capability to dispatch the applications to several virtual
desktops (visualized under the search box).</li>
<li>A search engine for applications, files and even contacts.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Time manager</strong>, at the center of the top bar, has
an on click calendar, linked to the mail client, calendar and

<p><strong>Gnome Flashback</strong> offers a Gnome 3 session that will

Gnome Flashback offers a simple and clean interface, while retaining the
main features of the Gnome 3 desktop.</p>

<p>Gnome Flashback offers fewer applications than the default
Gnome-Shell desktop, but you will find the essentials softwares for the
daily use of your computer.</p>
<p>This session was first offered as an alternative to the Gnome-Shell
session in the form of a Classic Gnome session (<a
href="#the-gnome-classic-interface">chap.7.1.1.4</a>). Although this
alternative still exists on Gnome-Shell, Gnome Flashback is now an
independent desktop available upon installation of Debian.</p>
<p>This desktop also features the Gnome Help utility, making getting
started with your system particularly easy.</p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">The KDE Plasma desktop on

</figure>
<p><strong>KDE</strong> is a project delivering a graphical environment
(called “Plasma”) and a full set of applications. KDE is highly
configurable, both in terms of desktop environment and supported
applications. KDE has so many capabilities that some people even find
difficult to deal with it. Note that you can use KDE without any
particular configuration tuning. It can be fully functional with its
“out-of-the-box” settings.</p>
<p>The KDE environment is visually close to Windows®, and offers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>KDE Application launcher</strong>: the menu giving you
access to the entire system.</li>
<li><strong>Graphical components</strong>: the modules you can place
anywhere on your desktop to enjoy additional functionalities.</li>
<li><strong>Activity manager</strong>: a banner which integrates your
pending tasks, your appointments… another way to help you with your
daily work.</li>
<li><strong>Plasma</strong>: KDE is delivered with a collection of
applications integrated in the “Plasma” desktop, and providing a fluid
and consistent graphical experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>More than any other GNU/Linux desktop, you can transform KDE
according to your needs and desires.<br />
KDE is a very complete environment and has a configuration center, as
well as a built-in help center.<br />
To launch the control center, navigate to the main menu &gt;
Applications &gt; Configuration &gt; System Settings.</p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">KDE System Settings on
Debian</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If you cannot find an application, you can enter its name or function
in the search box of the main menu.</p>
<p>KDE uses <strong>Konqueror</strong>, a file manager that is also able
to surf the Web… No need to open several applications to consult, view,
classify, etc. Here after, a split view of Konqueror in action:</p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">MATE desktop on Debian</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>MATE</strong> is a fork of GNOME 2. This means that this
desktop environment was started from a copy of GNOME 2 and then modified
independently.</p>
<p>This is the perfect environment for people who do not want to change
all the work habits they acquired when using GNOME 2. This is also a
good system for the computer aided music and the resource-intensive
applications going with.</p>
<p>Mate aims to be lighter than GNOME 3, and as such, is more suitable
for aging or resource limited computers. It’s clearly a good compromise
between GNOME 3 and Xfce 4.</p>
<p>Mate offers a “traditional” interface with its two task bars:</p>
<ul>
<li>The top panel includes, on the left, the main applications, the main
folders and the system setting menu.</li>
<li>The right part of the top panel is reserved to the notification area
and the quick settings (Audio volume, keyboard configuration, small
agenda).</li>
<li>The bottom panel includes the desktop button (to mask all the
application windows), the list of the active windows, and the virtual
desktops selector.</li>
</ul>
<p>To configure Mate you open the control center (“system” menu &gt;
Control Center) and you have access to the various components of this
interface:</p>

<p><strong>Mate</strong> is a minimal environment which ships with few
applications by default. You would be able to pick your favorite tools
later on. However, Mate embeds its own file system manager, Caja, which
is a <em>fork</em> of Nautilus (Gnome file manager), as well as a rather
well designed Help Center.</p>

<p><strong>Cinnamon</strong> is a desktop environment derived from the
Gnome-Shell project. It moved away from the all-in-one interface of this
latter, to adopt a more traditional interface (dash board along with a
menu where Icons are sorted by categories).<br />
Cinnamon offers a complete desktop with all the helpful (or not)
applications for your daily usage.</p>
<p>Cinnamon uses the <strong>Nemo</strong> file system manager, a fork
from Nautilus, which reinstates some functionalities removed by the
latter: compact view, open in a terminal, open as root, etc.</p>
<p>The Cinnamon configuration is delegated to the system settings pannel
which centralized all the system and user settings:</p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">The default Xfce on Debian</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>Xfce</strong> is a lightweight desktop environment for Unix
type operating systems. Its goals are to be fast, little greedy in
machine resources, but visually attractive and user friendly. It is
expandable, thanks to numerous available plug-ins, and embeds a volume
control application (xfce4-mixer), its own window manager supporting
transparency, shades … (xfwm4), an integrated archive manager
(thunar-archive-plugin), and disk, battery network, processor and memory
monitoring tools, as well as various themes and miscellaneous
plug-ins.</p>
<p>This interface is clear and traditional: you won’t be surprised
during your first encounter with it.</p>
<p>Xfce has the significant advantage of being fully modular, because it
is released with different independent plug-ins. Xfce also allows the
integration of applications coming from other environments, and is able
to launch, during the system start-up, the Gnome and/or KDE services by
default.</p>
<p><strong>It is a perfect environment for beginners</strong>, offering
a great stability, a complete graphical handling (“with the mouse
only”), and evolution capabilities with no real limit.</p>
<p>Like the other previously seen environments, Xfce centralizes its
configuration settings to ease the customization. Note that each
elements can also be configured from its specific interface (like a
right-click on the panel to add a new launcher, for example).</p>

<p><strong>LXDE</strong> is a free desktop environment for Unix like
systems, and other systems. The LXDE name is the acronym for
“Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment”.<br />
And as its name implies, the goal of this project is to propose a fast
and lightweight desktop environment.</p>
<p>As opposed to other desktop environments, the various components are
not tightly linked together. Instead they are rather independents and
each of them can be used without the others, with very few dependencies
(packages used during the installation).</p>
<p>LXDE is notably light, making it an ideal solution for small hardware
configurations and computers refurbishing, but it requires a little more
time to learn and use its different elements.</p>
<p>The LXDE design model implies that the configuration of each element
needs to go through an interface designed for this specific application.
You will not find a “Control Center” akin to the Gnome one, but rather a
suite of lightweight tools to customize your environment.</p>

as window manager:</p>

<p><strong>LXQt</strong> is a light desktop environment. It offers a
classical but modern and lightweight interface that will let you work
without thinking about it. It comes with a series of specific tools to
take advantage of your favorite data and applications. It is an ideal
environment for old and low performance machines.</p>

<p>LXQt is the <strong>Qt</strong> variant (the graphic rendering engine
of <a href="#kde">KDE</a>) of <a href="#lxdeopenbox">LXDE</a> (which
works with <strong>Gtk</strong>, another graphics rendering engine). You
will therefore find certain similarities between these two
environments.</p>
<p>Its lightness does not prevent it from having a centralized
configuration tool allowing you to access the settings of the main
system functions: Menu &gt; Preferences &gt; LXQt Settings&gt; LXQt
configuration center.</p>

<p>The following sections describe the classical <strong>Single-boot
installation</strong>: Debian will be the only distribution residing on
your hard disk and the install process will be automatic (assisted
partitioning, with the whole Debian system in a single partition).</p>
<p><strong>This manual is intended for beginners</strong>, and does not
cover all the install capabilities of the Debian system. If you are in a
particular situation not covered here, look at the on-line Debian
installation manual (<a
href="https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/installmanual">https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/installmanual</a>).<br />
For installations in a different context (separated /home partition,
Dual-Boot, Multi-Boot, Logical Volume Management, Encryption, etc.) you
will find the links to the specific documentations in <a
href="#on-line-installation-details">chapter 5.5</a>.</p>
<h2 data-number="5.1" id="before-installing"><span
class="header-section-number">5.1</span> Before installing</h2>
<p>Most of the users never had to install a system previously (computers
are usualy delivered with an operating system already installed). And
that could be a little freaking … Make the time to be well prepared,
take a breath of fresh air, and everything is going to be all right <img
src="img/smile/cool.png" />.</p>
<h3 data-number="5.1.1" id="hardware-compatibility"><span
class="header-section-number">5.1.1</span> Hardware compatibility</h3>
<p>One of the first questions when you want to install Debian concerns
the hardware compatibility: <em>is Debian going to run smoothly on my
computer??</em></p>
<p>A fast and simple way to check this out, is to type “Debian” followed
by your machine type, within your favorite search engine: look for
“Debian IBM T60”, for example. In case of doubts, don’t hesitate to ask
on a support-and-help forum (<a
href="#where-to-find-help">chap.1.2</a>).</p>
<p>In order to be really sure, you can use a distribution offering a
test capability through a “live” session (<a
href="#testing-debian-in-live-session">chap.5.3.1</a>).</p>
<h3 data-number="5.1.2" id="backing-up-your-data"><span
class="header-section-number">5.1.2</span> Backing up your data</h3>
<p>If you anticipate to overwrite your hard disk with Debian, verify
first that none of your personal data is in there: everything will be
lost.</p>
<p><strong>Remember to back-up your data</strong> before you start
messing with your existing partitions (<a
href="#back-up-your-data">chap.9</a>).</p>
<h3 data-number="5.1.3" id="disk-space-requirement"><span
class="header-section-number">5.1.3</span> Disk space requirement</h3>
<p>A Debian distribution occupies 10 GB in average, but you should still
plan for a minimum of 15 GB, to be able to download the updates. For
greater safety and if you plan to add few applications, reserve 20 GB
and you will be comfortable.</p>
<h3 data-number="5.1.4" id="installation-time-duration"><span
class="header-section-number">5.1.4</span> Installation time
duration</h3>
<p><strong>To install Debian</strong> from a “net-install” ISO requires
some time because the software is downloaded from the Debian servers
during the process: the time duration needed for the installation then
depends on the speed and quality of your Internet connection and may
vary from 40 up to 90 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>To install a derivative</strong> from a Debian Live support,
takes far less time (around 20 minutes, depending on your computer
power), because the packages are already included within the downloaded
ISO image. However, a system update will then be necessary after the
installation, because the embedded packages are dating back to the time
when the ISO image was burned.</p>
<h3 data-number="5.1.5" id="preparing-the-hard-disk"><span
class="header-section-number">5.1.5</span> Preparing the hard disk</h3>
<p>If you anticipate to install Debian as the unique operating system on
your machine, you don’t have to do anything special: the embedded
installer includes the tools needed to prepare (I.E. to format) the
disk(s).</p>
<p>If you anticipate to install Debian next to another operating system,
take good care in preparing your hard disk (like running a
defragmentation of the Windows partition for example). More details in
the section dedicated to specific installations (<a
href="#on-line-installation-details">chap.5.5</a>).</p>
<h2 data-number="5.2" id="downloading-debian"><span
class="header-section-number">5.2</span> Downloading Debian</h2>
<p>Debian ISO images offered for each desktop flavors, in several
architecture variations, and supported by various media like netinst,
CD, DVD, … are directly available from its website <a
href="https://www.debian.org/distrib/">https://www.debian.org/distrib/</a>.</p>
<h3 data-number="5.2.1" id="which-image-to-download"><span
class="header-section-number">5.2.1</span> Which image to download?</h3>
<p>Here after the different ways to obtain a Debian ISO image. If you
have other questions, read the Debian FAQ: <a
href="https://www.debian.org/CD/faq/index.en.html">https://www.debian.org/CD/faq/index.en.html</a>.</p>
<h4 data-number="5.2.1.1" id="debian-netinst"><span
class="header-section-number">5.2.1.1</span> Debian Netinst</h4>
<p>If your Internet connection is stable, we encourage you to download
an ISO image of type “Netinst” which includes everything you need to
install Debian on any modern 32 or 64 bits (i386 or amd64) computer,
with all the desired options: you will be able to choose your main
interface during the installation process.</p>
<ul>
<li>The advantage of this ISO image is that it will search for
applications on the Debian servers during the installation, allowing you
to get a completely up-to-date system.</li>
<li>The disadvantage is that you will need absolutely a network
connection during the installation, either wired (by cable, recognized
natively in most cases) or wireless (Wi-Fi), when it’s recognized.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the ISO image used in the installation section of this
manual.</p>
<p>To get hold of the “Netinst” ISO image, you can visit this page: <a
href="https://www.debian.org/CD/netinst/index.en.html">https://www.debian.org/CD/netinst/index.en.html</a>.
You will find there the torrent links (to share and relieve the load on
the main servers) and the direct “HTTP” to the ISO images, depending on
your architecture. Below the torrent link to a 64-bit ISO image:</p>

<p>Note that since Debian 12 Bookworm, installation media include
specific non-free drivers and firmware for specific hardware (for a
Wi-Fi installation for example).</p>
<h4 data-number="5.2.1.2" id="debian-on-cddvd"><span
class="header-section-number">5.2.1.2</span> Debian on CD/DVD</h4>
<p>To obtain a classic bootable ISO image, pre-configured with a
specific desktop, you can look at this page: <a
href="https://www.debian.org/CD/http-ftp/index.en.html">https://www.debian.org/CD/http-ftp/index.en.html</a>.</p>
<p>This ISO file <strong>does not</strong> let you test your system,
through a “live” session (<a
href="#testing-debian-in-live-session">chap.5.3.1</a>) to check the
hardware compatibility with your PC. It <em>only</em> allows you to
install Debian on your computer, which is already cool, and let you
install directly your preferred desktop, without needing a stable
Internet connection at your disposal.</p>
<h4 data-number="5.2.1.3" id="debian-live"><span
class="header-section-number">5.2.1.3</span> Debian live</h4>
<p>Other images, called “autonomous”, are also available: they let you
check your particular environment through a “live” session. They include
also an installation launcher on the desktop, which, once your tests are
completed, let you install Debian directly from the session you are in.
To get hold of a live image, you can visit this page: <a
href="https://www.debian.org/CD/live/index.en.html">https://www.debian.org/CD/live/index.en.html</a>.</p>

class="header-section-number">5.2.1.4</span> Debian torrent</h4>
<p>To relieve the main Debian servers and, at the same time, share your
ISO image with other community members, you can use the BitTorent
protocol.</p>
<p>To obtain the list of the available “torrents”, you can visit this
page: <a

<h3 data-number="5.2.2" id="verifying-the-iso-image-integrity"><span
class="header-section-number">5.2.2</span> Verifying the ISO image
integrity</h3>
<p>In order to verify the integrity of the transferred image, Debian
computes the “<strong>SHA sum</strong>” (short form of “SHA256 check
sum”). This check can be used on all kind of data, but is particularly
useful when downloading ISO images.</p>
<p>Note that the SHA256 sums indicated in this manual are only for
example purose: remember to check the real SHAsum of your file on the
download site.</p>
<h4 data-number="5.2.2.1" id="checking-sha256-on-gnulinux"><span
class="header-section-number">5.2.2.1</span> Checking SHA256 on
GNU/Linux</h4>
<p>The <strong>sha256sum</strong> checking tool is integrated in almost
all the GNU/Linux distributions. To verify the SHA256 checksum of a
file, just type the following command in a terminal emulator, including
the path of the file to be checked:</p>
<pre><code>user@debian-pc: cd ~/Downloads
user@debian-pc:~/Downloads sha256sum debian-12.0.0-amd64-netinst.iso</code></pre>
<p>which will return a result of the type (to be checked against the
SHAsum given by the download site.):</p>
<pre><code>ae6d563d2444665316901fe7091059ac34b8f67ba30f9159f7cef7d2fdc5bf8a  debian-12.0.0-amd64-netinst.iso</code></pre>
<p><strong>Verification in graphic mode (“with the
mouse”).</strong><br />
The <strong><a
href="https://packages.debian.org/fr/bookworm/gtkhash">Gtkhash</a></strong>
program let you also check the SHA256 signature, but with a graphical
interface.</p>
<ul>
<li>Install ‘gtkhash’ (using a Terminal command or the Synaptic package
manager),</li>
<li>Launch GtkHash from the application menu,</li>
<li>In the <em>File</em> field: look for the ISO file to be
checked,</li>
<li>In the <em>Check</em> field: paste the checksum retrieved from the
Internet site. For the debian-netinst amd64 ISO image, check on this
page: <a
href="https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/amd64/iso-cd/SHA256SUMS">https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/amd64/iso-cd/SHA256SUMS</a>.</li>

<p><img src="img/apps/dvd.png#left" /><br />
To burn your Debian ISO file on a CD/DVD using a computer under
GNU/Linux, simply open your favorite burning application, indicate the
path of the ‘debian-xx-iso’ downloaded file, and start the media
burning.</p>
<p>For the Microsoft® users, read this tutorial made for the Windows®

class="header-section-number">5.2.4</span> ISO transfer on a USB
key</h3>
<p><img src="img/misc/usb.png#left" /><br />
The USB key is the most convenient way to install GNU/Linux
distributions, because you can change them as often as you want and even
test several of them in parallel. The key also secures your tests
because once the session is over, no trace is left on the key nor on the
computer which booted from it.</p>
<h4 data-number="5.2.4.1"
id="from-a-gnulinux-system-with-the-terminal"><span
class="header-section-number">5.2.4.1</span> From a GNU/Linux system
with the terminal</h4>
<p>Transfer will be done with the terminal, this is the recommended
method. However, there is this a graphical tool, <strong>Etcher</strong>
from Balena <a
href="https://etcher.balena.io/">https://etcher.balena.io/</a></p>
<p>Plug your USB key in and launch a terminal in “root” administrator
mode (<a href="#administrator-mode-example">chap.3.8.3</a>). We are
going to identify the USB key to be used, with the command:</p>
<pre><code>blkid</code></pre>
<p>which returns information of this type:</p>
<pre><code>/dev/sda1: LABEL=&quot;system&quot; UUID=&quot;3d378712-1b6e-4f66-b9e8-2a6673c62199&quot; TYPE=&quot;ext4&quot;
/dev/sda5: UUID=&quot;65bdec62-8d0e-49ca-b70b-c99340e4ee5e&quot; TYPE=&quot;swap&quot;
/dev/sdb1: UUID=&quot;F9B8-E691&quot; TYPE=&quot;vfat&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Here, our key is identified as <strong>UUID=“F9B8-E691”</strong>, is
formated in “vfat” and includes the <strong>sdb1</strong> partition.
Note carefully this <strong>sdb1</strong> value, to avoid erasing by
mistake a partition on your internal hard disk (here
<strong>sda1</strong> is another partition on this disk).</p>
<p>The Debian ISO file should be located in the Downloads folder. Let’s
move in there to act on this ISO file (the “$HOME” variable replaces the
address “/home/your_loginID”):</p>
<pre><code>cd $HOME/Downloads</code></pre>
<p>Now, we are going to transfer the ISO content to the USB key, thanks
to the “<strong>dd</strong>” command. <strong>Take good care of naming
the USB key device “<em>sdb</em>” and not “<em>sdb1</em>”</strong> (in
our example), because it is the disk device name which is requested, not
the partition, and don’t forget to change the <em>xx</em> in the
‘debian-xx.iso’ file by the corresponding real version number.<br />
Within a terminal in “root” administrator mode (<a
href="#administrator-mode-example">chap.3.8.3</a>):</p>
<pre><code>dd if=debian-xx.iso of=/dev/sdb bs=4M status=progress; sync</code></pre>
<p>The transfer duration on the USB key is obviously depending on the
size of the ISO and on the transfer rate of your USB port. This
operation usually lasts from 10 to 15 minutes without any sign of
activity within the terminal window. Once the transfer is completed, the
control will be given back to you, that is a new command line prompt
will be displayed in the terminal.</p>
<p>Note that you can use the minimal <strong>cp</strong> command to
transfer ISO file, but you won’t see the copy progress. Whithin a
terminal in administrator mode:</p>
<pre><code>cp debian-xx.iso /dev/sdb; sync</code></pre>

<p>Win32DiskImager is a bootable media creation utility for Windows®: it
will allow you to create a USB key from which you will then boot your
computer in order to install Debian.<br />
To install it on your Windows® system, go to the main project page and
download the latest version: <a
href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/">https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/</a><br />
Win32DiskImager installs like other Windows®-compatible software. Once
in place, first plug your USB stick in and note the ID of the new disk
displayed (disk “F:” for example). Then run Win32DiskImager.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>1</strong>, you will choose the downloaded Debian ISO image:
Click on the folder icon to open the file picker. Win32DiskImager only
looks for files of type “.img” by default: remember to set the search
filter to “.iso” instead of “.img” in order to view your debian-xxx.iso
file.</li>
<li><strong>2</strong>, you will indicate the device to be used: it is
the disk mounted when inserting your USB key. <strong>Caution! All data
on this key will be deleted</strong> during the transfer procedure.</li>
<li><strong>3</strong>, you start the ISO image transfer to the key. You
can follow the progress of the process directly in the Win32DiskImager
window.</li>
</ul>
<p>Wait a moment and you will be in possession of a bootable Debian USB
key! You still have to restart your computer from this bootable key and
begin the Debian installation.</p>
<h3 data-number="5.2.5"
id="booting-from-the-cddvd-or-the-usb-device"><span
class="header-section-number">5.2.5</span> Booting from the CD/DVD or
the USB device</h3>
<p>To proceed now with the Debian installation, using your CD/DVD or USB
medium, you need to ask the computer to boot from this device. If your
computer does not boot automatically from the desired installation
medium, you need to access the “Boot menu” or modify the “Boot order” in
the BIOS.</p>
<p>Some computers have a function key that let you boot directly from a
peripheral device, without having to modify the BIOS parameters.
Usually, pressing the F12 key at start-up gives you access directly to
the boot options. On the other end, to access the BIOS configuration you
need to tap one key like DEL, ESC or F2 during the start-up phase. More
information at: <a
href="https://www.boot-disk.com/manual/index.html#bios-boot.html">https://www.boot-disk.com/manual/index.html#bios-boot.html</a></p>
<h4 data-number="5.2.5.1" id="the-boot-menu"><span
class="header-section-number">5.2.5.1</span> The Boot Menu</h4>
<p>As mentioned above, the key to access the Boot Menu at start-up may
vary from one computer to another. This specific key and the key to
access the BIOS configuration are usually indicated during the boot
sequence for one or two second:</p>
<figure>

<p>The boot menu let you select the boot peripheral without going into
the BIOS configuration :</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/05-install/10-bootmenu-2.jpg"
alt="Select a disk to boot from" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Select a disk to boot from</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Use the keyboard direction arrows to select the right peripheral (in
this example the USB key is the “Removable Devices”).</p>
<p>When you reach the BIOS settings, you should check if, within the
Hard Disk Drive entry, there is a tree you can expand and where the USB
key is showing up. In that case you can move your USB key up to the
first position, by using the F5/F6 keys on your keyboard.</p>
<h4 data-number="5.2.5.2" id="bios-configuration"><span
class="header-section-number">5.2.5.2</span> BIOS configuration</h4>
<p>If the Boot-order menu is not available, you must modify the Boot
priority inside the BIOS.</p>
<p>Once entered in the BIOS settings, the operations to execute are very
simple, but you should be extremely careful to not modify other
parameters. Hopefully, in case of mistake, the program let you quit
without recording the changes, by pressing the ESC (or Escape) key.
Other keys like F9 or F10 will let you reload the default parameters, or
to record the changes before quitting:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>F9</strong>: reload default parameters (or factory
settings)</li>
<li><strong>F10</strong>: record the modifications and quit</li>
<li><strong>ESC</strong>: cancel the modifications and quit</li>
</ul>
<p>The navigation is done by using the directional arrows on the
keyboard. One validate or enter inside an option using the
<strong>ENTER</strong> key. In most of the BIOS models, you move until
the <strong>Boot</strong> menu is highlighted, then find the peripheral
selection for the boot (boot device, boot sequence, boot priority) and
finally put the various devices in the first, second, third etc …
positions, reflecting the boot order you wish to apply.</p>

<strong>CD/DVD</strong> or <strong>CD-ROM</strong></li>
<li>A <strong>Hard disk</strong> will usually appear as
<strong>HDD</strong>, <strong>HARD DRIVE</strong>, <strong>SSD</strong>
or <strong>HARD DISK</strong> or even <strong>IDE~</strong> …</li>
<li>A <strong>USB</strong> peripheral will usually appear as <strong>USB

<p>The correct handling of the UEFI SecureBoot is available since Debian
10 Buster, for the AMD64, i386 and ARM64 architectures. This implies
that one can now test and install Debian without the need to disable the
SecureBoot option: <a

<img src="img/smile/cool.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Changing the boot order</strong></p>
<p>You still have to change the boot order so that the computer starts
first from the USB (or the DVD). Click on the “Boot” tab and modify the
order, if necessary, so that your medium becomes the first of the list
as explained on the previous chapter (BIOS).</p>

<h2 data-number="5.3" id="testing-debian-safely"><span
class="header-section-number">5.3</span> Testing Debian safely</h2>
<p>The best way to make your choice: try the system directly on your
computer!<br />
There are two possibilities: you can test a GNU/Linux distribution from
a stand-alone “Live” session or directly from your windows® system
thanks to a virtualization software: VirtualBox or VMWare.</p>
<h3 data-number="5.3.1" id="testing-debian-in-live-session"><span
class="header-section-number">5.3.1</span> Testing Debian in Live

<figure>
<img src="img/05-install/13-install-menu-live.jpg"
alt="Launching Debian Live session" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Launching Debian Live
session</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Debian provides standalone “Live” images for safe testing a given
environment. Their peculiarity is to change nothing on the computer,
everything happens in RAM and is forgotten once the computer is turned
off. These images have a setup launcher on the desktop that allows you,
once tested, to install Debian directly from your session.<br />
To get a live image, visit this page : <a
href="https://www.debian.org/CD/live/index.html">https://www.debian.org/CD/live/index.html</a>.</p>
<p><img src="img/misc/noob-info.png#left" /><br />
<strong>The principle of the Live CD</strong> is the capability to
use/test a distribution on a computer without any risks for your
personal data. The Live also let you check the distribution
compatibility with your hardware.<br />
The Debian software is “compressed” within a special file (the
‘squashfs.filesystem’ file) and embedded in the downloaded ISO image.
This same special file is “uncompressed” during the Live utilization,
and will later be copied on your hard disk during the installation
process.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> on live session, default user is
“<strong>user</strong>” and default password is
“<strong>live</strong>”.</p>
<h4 data-number="5.3.1.1"
id="debian-install-using-calamares-within-a-live-session"><span
class="header-section-number">5.3.1.1</span> Debian install using
Calamares within a Live session</h4>
<p>Whichever version you choose (Gnome, KDE, Xfce…), you will find on
the desktop, and/or within the “System” menu, an entry to directly
install Debian. After having checked your machine compatibility, you
will be able to directly install the selected environment from the
“Live” session. If you can’t find the dedicated icon on your desktop,
open your applications menu and search for “calamares”.</p>

<p><strong>Warning:</strong> This installation method is not the one
encouraged by default. The Live install involves a risk: if for one
reason or another, the graphical interface freezes, the whole
installation process will be compromised.</p>
<p>if you choose this option, this is the <strong>Calamares</strong>
graphical installer which will be launched in order to set your system
up. Here, within a Live session, you start with your language
selection:</p>

<p>The <strong>Partitions</strong> tab is the most important one,
because it let you modify your computer disk(s) layout : to be used with
extreme care. For a <em>single boot</em> install (Debian will be the
only system hosted by the machine), you can select “Erase disk”. For a
<em>dual-boot</em> (next to another system), select “Install along
side”. In case of doubt send a question to the forum (<a

<strong>Virtualbox</strong> (<a
href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">https://www.virtualbox.org/</a>) is a
virtualization software available for major operating systems. This
software will allow you to test your Debian or any other GNU/Linux OS
directly on your Windows® desktop. Virtualbox is not the only
virtualization software: more information about virtualization on
Wikipedia (<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtualization#Nested_virtualization">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtualization#Nested_virtualization</a>).</p>
<p>Internet is full of tutorials about installing VirtualBox. I leave it
up to you to consult these few links which will let you quickly master
this software:</p>
<ul>
<li>WikiHow documentation: <a
href="https://www.wikihow.com/Install-VirtualBox">https://www.wikihow.com/Install-VirtualBox</a>

<strong>… We enter the virtual world here??</strong><br />
A kind of. The virtualization software makes it possible to test or
install <strong>a system inside a system</strong>, and to ensure the
independence of the two installations. VirtualBox will “make believe”
the system you want to test (referred to as “<em>guest system</em>”)
that it is all alone on its computer, while ensuring exchanges (shared
folder, network connection sharing, etc.) with the <em>host
system</em>.<br />
Your guest system will be installed on a “virtual disk”, which will
simply be like a big archive in a folder of your documents.<br />
Note that this test method does not verify hardware compatibility and is
only for you to discover a distribution before installing it on your
hard drive.</p>

<strong>… “Partitioning” … What’s that?</strong><br />
The partitioning process consists in organizing different partitions on
your system. Partitions are non-overlapping area defined on your hard
disk(s), each one of them having its specific properties (file system
type, unique identifier, size, etc.). In order to function correctly,
Debian GNU/Linux needs at least one partition to install the operating
system. An additional exchange partition (called SWAP) is highly
recommended, to deal not only with insufficient memory space, but also
with the suspend or hibernation functionality.<br />
The guided partitioning scheme proposes 2 partitions (system + swap),
but you can opt for a scheme proposing a separated “/home” partition,
and use another hard disk to store your personal data (as an
example).</p>

<strong>… where should I put this mirror?</strong><br />
<strong>“A repository mirror”</strong> is a computer server, available
on-line, hosting the full set of the Debian packages. If you don’t have
all the CDs on hand, Debian will grab the software or the packages you
need on the network mirror servers.<br />
There are repository servers all around the world, each one being the
exact copy (mirror) of the others. In this example we select “Yes” and
in the following section we will pick an Internet mirror located in the
United Kingdom.</p>
<p>The beginner’s handbook being English-speaking, the default choice
“United Kingdom” seems obvious. However, you should be careful and
select a nearby mirror, if you live in another English speaking
country.</p>

<li><strong>Debian desktop environment</strong> let you install, or not,
a desktop. The desktop environment installation can be done later on, or
never, and it is not indispensable, for example on a server. But if you
are a beginner, a graphical interface will be easier to master.<br />
In this example, the Gnome environment is used. Please note that you can
install several of them: they will be available from the session
manager.</li>
<li><strong>web server</strong> includes a preselection of packages
dedicated to Web servers.</li>
<li><strong>SSH server</strong> allows you to activate the ssh protocol,
and computer remote control. <strong>Warning!</strong> Enabling the SSH
service might create a security breach if it is not correctly

<p>Debian offers more possibilities than just the two methods explained
in the previous chapters.<br />
But this manual being intended for the beginners, we kept it simple and
the more complex installation modes are detailed in the official Debian
documentation: <a
href="https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/installmanual">https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/installmanual</a></p>
<p>Just to give you a flavor of the other installation modes:</p>
<h3 data-number="5.5.1" id="dual-boot-installation"><span
class="header-section-number">5.5.1</span> Dual-boot installation</h3>
<p>The <strong>Dual-boot</strong> mechanism let you install side-by-side
two independent operating systems, and doing so, allows you to select,
at boot time, which one you want to launch.</p>
<p><img src="img/misc/warning.png#left" /><br />
<strong>This is not the recommended method</strong>: there are inherent
risks for your data during the partition resizing. If you choose this
solution to get started on Debian, please remember that you can very
well test it first by using a <strong>Live session</strong> (<a
href="#testing-debian-in-live-session">chap.5.3.1</a>) with no risks for
your data.</p>

<h3 data-number="5.5.2" id="lvm-whats-that"><span
class="header-section-number">5.5.2</span> LVM … what’s that?</h3>
<p><strong>LVM</strong> is an acronym for <strong>L</strong>ogical
<strong>V</strong>olume <strong>M</strong>anager.</p>
<p>Its usage consists in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a specific partition of type “LVM” (which corresponds to a
mounted <strong>disk</strong>)</li>
<li>Within this partition we can create “Logical Volumes” (corresponding
to <strong>partitions</strong>) that we can modify at will, themselves
sized and formatted to our own convenience.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, the “Logical Volumes” utilization, replaces straight out the
usual disk “partitioning”, and provide a more flexible way to manage
disk space by allowing modifications on them at any point of time.</p>
<p>It is possible, as well, to keep one part of the LVM partition
without installed “Logical Volume”, pending further decisions.</p>

<h3 data-number="5.5.3" id="encryption-whats-for"><span
class="header-section-number">5.5.3</span> Encryption … what’s for?</h3>
<p>The confidentiality of personal data is is a pretty hot topic these
days. In order to better protect your data, you can opt for an
<strong>encrypted installation</strong>. With this kind of installation,
even in case of theft of your computer, or removal of its hard disk, no
data access is possible without the encrypting password !</p>
<p>The Debain Administrator’s Handbook provides us with more details (<a
href="https://debian-handbook.info/browse/en-US/stable/sect.installation-steps.html#sect.install-partman">https://debian-handbook.info/browse/en-US/stable/sect.installation-steps.html#sect.install-partman</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This feature can be added underneath any filesystem, since, as for
<strong>LVM</strong>, Linux (and more particularly the “dm-crypt”
driver) uses the Device Mapper to create a virtual partition (whose
content is protected) based on an underlying partition that will store
the data in an encrypted form (thanks to <strong>LUKS</strong>,
<strong>L</strong>inux <strong>U</strong>nified <strong>K</strong>ey
<strong>S</strong>etup, a standard format that enables the storage of
encrypted data as well as meta-information that indicates the encryption
algorithms used).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To put it simply, LUKS creates a container to host an encrypted
volume protected by a password.</p>

<p><strong>RAID</strong> is the acronym of <em>redundant array of

<p><strong>RAID</strong> is a data storage virtualization technology

Using either an Ethernet wired connection or a Wi-Fi wireless
connection, your Debian system is expected to access the network. The
Ethernet connection is recognized natively. As far as the Wi-Fi is
concerned, it is sometimes necessary to use a non-free driver.<br />
Fortunately, since version 12 “Bookworm”, Debian includes by default a
wide range of non-free firmware, enabling native use of most wireless
network cards.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>If your Wi-Fi connection is recognized natively</strong>,
jump directly to the Network manager sections (for the Gnome, Mate,
Cinnamon or Xfce desktop), ConnMan (for the LXDE desktop) or the
connection editors under KDE or LXQt.</li>
<li><strong>If you network device is not functioning</strong>, you need
to go to the “material recognition” section (<a

<h3 data-number="6.1.5" id="check-if-the-driver-is-present"><span
class="header-section-number">6.1.5</span> Check if the driver is
present</h3>
<p><strong>Drivers</strong> are often provided by the manufacturer, and
sometime also some <strong>Firmware</strong> (micro-program) which needs
to be loaded by the kernel inside the WI-FI device itself, using this
very same driver. So it is very important to check that the driver is
correctly installed in the system.</p>
<p>To do so, we are going to use the command <strong>ip
link</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>ip link</code></pre>
<p>which should return a result like:</p>
<pre><code>1: lo: &lt;LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode...
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
2: enp0s25: &lt;NO-CARRIER,BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast...

    link/ether e8:94:f6:16:7f:f3 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff</code></pre>
<p>If an interface named something like “wlp…” does not appear in the
list, this means that the Wi-Fi driver is missing.</p>

class="header-section-number">6.1.5.1</span> Identifying a network
device, and installing its driver</h4>
<p>If your network connection is not functioning, it is usually a driver
issue. In order to select the right one, we need first to identify the
network device.</p>
<p>Within a terminal in user mode, launch the <strong>lspci</strong>
command which lists all the available interfaces. If you use this
command alone, your terminal window will be filled up with all kinds of
information. In order to help you sorting out all these data, we are
going to complement the <strong>lspci</strong> command with a
<em>grep</em> and a <em>cut</em>, like this:</p>
<pre><code>lspci | grep -i &quot;net&quot; | cut -d: -f3</code></pre>
<p>which will return a result like:</p>
<pre><code>Intel Corporation 82567LM Gigabit Network Connection (rev 03)
Broadcom Corporation BCM4322 802.11a/b/g/n Wireless LAN Controller ...</code></pre>
<p>Here, the detected Wi-Fi device is the <strong>Broadcom
BCM4322</strong></p>
<p>If I run a simple Internet search, like “<em>Debian Broadcom
BCM4322</em>”, I will find quickly the right page (<a

class="header-section-number">6.2</span> Configuring your printer</h2>
<p><img src="img/apps/print.png#left" /><br />
C.U.P.S (<a
href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Unix_Printing_System">https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Unix_Printing_System</a>),
is an acronym for <strong>C</strong>ommon <strong>U</strong>nix
<strong>P</strong>rinting <strong>S</strong>ystem, and as its name
suggests, is a printer management system created by Apple Inc. for OSX
and other Unix-like systems. It is used by default on Debian to manage
printers. To achieve this, CUPS uses the Internet Printing Protocol
(ipp) to drive both the local and the network printers.<br />
What is enough for you to remember is that CUPS is the tool managing the
printers.</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility</strong></p>
<p>Likewise Wi-Fi devices, printers need external drivers. However their
detection by default is much better, which enables Debian to embed a
simplified printer setting interface (detailed in the first section of
this chapter). Methods may vary from one manufacturer to another.</p>
<ul>
<li>for Brother: visit the dedicated page: <a
href="https://support.brother.com/g/b/">https://support.brother.com/g/b/</a>,</li>
<li>for Epson: add the following repository (<a
href="#modifying-the-repositories">chap.8.1.4</a>) to your
“sources.list” file: “deb
http://download.ebz.epson.net/dsc/op/stable/debian/ lsb3.2 main”
(without the quotes)</li>
<li>for HP: make sure the ‘hplip’ package is installed on your machine.
If your printer is very recent, visit the dedicated page <a
href="https://developers.hp.com/hp-linux-imaging-and-printing">https://developers.hp.com/hp-linux-imaging-and-printing</a>,
download the packages corresponding to tour printer for the Debian
system (files ending by “.deb”) and install these packages using either
the <strong>dpkg</strong> or <strong>gdebi</strong> tool (<a
href="#installing-external-.deb-packages">chap.8.7</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>To check your printer compatibility, you can visit the dedicated page
of the openprinting.org site: <a
href="https://www.openprinting.org/printers">https://www.openprinting.org/printers</a>.</p>
<p><img src="img/misc/noob-info.png#left" /><br />
Regardless of the chosen method, don’t forget to plug the power cord at
both ends, to verify that the paper tray is not empty, to connect the
printer either directly to your computer, or to the local network, and
to turn its power on.</p>
<h3 data-number="6.2.1"
id="simplified-graphical-method-with-system-config-printer"><span
class="header-section-number">6.2.1</span> Simplified graphical method
with system-config-printer</h3>
<p>The Debian GNU/Linux desktops include the
<strong>system-config-printer</strong> tool, a simplified graphical
manager to add and configure your printer.</p>
<p>If you followed the Debian classic installation procedure, this tool
is already present on your system and can be found usually at “System
&gt; Print Settings”, or in the Control Centers for Gnome or KDE. If you
don’t find it, simply open a terminal and launch:</p>
<pre><code>system-config-printer</code></pre>
<p>If a message indicates that the printing service is not available, it
is enough to press the “Start the service” button in the very same
message window. You will be asked to enter your password. If this does
not improve the situation, chances are that the CUPS package is not
installed.</p>
<p>Within a terminal in admin mode, install the CUPS package:</p>
<pre><code>apt update &amp;&amp; apt install cups</code></pre>
<p>Then re-boot your system to take into account these
modifications.</p>
<p>If everything went well, the printer configuration program then
displays this message window when the <em>system-config-printer</em> is
launched:</p>
<figure>

alt="System-config-printer: default interface" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">System-config-printer: default

<p>Click on the “Add” button to get the list of detected printers. If
the button is disabled, click on “Unlock”.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/06-start/22-printer-unlock.jpg"
alt="System-config-printer : unlock applcation" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">System-config-printer : unlock

</figure>
<p>Then you access the “New Printer” window which presents the local or
network “Detected Devices” list. Select your printer and click the
“Forward” button:</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/06-start/23-printer-cfg-2.jpg" alt="Printer selection" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Printer selection</figcaption>

<p>If your printer was correctly detected, its driver has been selected
for you. You can describe your printer in the next window. Once you are
done with the modifications click on the “Apply” button:</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/06-start/24-printer-cfg-3.jpg"

<p>The installer then ask you if you want to test the printer:</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/06-start/25-printer-cfg-4.jpg" alt="Print test page?" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Print test page?</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The printer is now correctly added to your machine. It is available
for the printing tasks executed by any of the installed applications on
your system (LibreOffice, Evince (for pdf files), etc.).</p>
<p>To change your printer settings, double-click on its icon:</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/06-start/26-printer-cfg-5.jpg"
alt="Printer configuration" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Printer configuration</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Small hint: to change the printer behavior in case of error, go to
your printer settings, click on the “Policies” category, and select the
“<strong>Abort job</strong>” option (instead of “<strong>Stop
printer</strong>”) in the “Error policy” field.</p>
<h3 data-number="6.2.2" id="universal-graphical-method-with-cups"><span

<p>The simplified interface is handy, but the classic CUPS interface is
no longer as austere as it used to be. You can access it from your
Internet navigator since CUPS is a <em>print server</em> offering a web
interface.</p>
<p>So let’s meet on the page <a
href="http://localhost:631/printers/">http://localhost:631/printers/</a>
which displays all the detected printers (don’t forget to connect your
printer either directly to your computer, or to the local network, and
to turn its power on).</p>

<h2 data-number="6.3" id="check-for-updates"><span
class="header-section-number">6.3</span> Check for updates</h2>
<p><img src="img/apps/update.png#left" /><br />
<strong>Debian updates</strong> have nothing to do with <em>Windows’
updates</em>…<br />
The GNU/Linux system updates are the <strong>direct evidence of one of
the free software strengths: the public sources</strong>.</p>
<p>As opposed to the proprietary systems, hiding their software flaws
(since they <em>sell</em> it) as long as possible, the free
distributions publish their software flaws as soon as they are
discovered and fix them immediately.</p>
<p>So, when a small window suddenly pops up and invite you to update
your system, say yes, of course, and your computer will thank you a all
lot.</p>
<ul>
<li>Updates using a <em>terminal</em> (<a
href="#update-with-a-terminal">chap.6.3.1</a>)</li>
<li>Updates using the <em>Synaptic</em> package manager (<a
href="#updating-the-system-with-synaptic">chap.8.5.3</a>)</li>
<li>Updates using <em>Discover</em> on KDE (<a
href="#discover-updating-your-applications">chap.8.4.3</a>)</li>
<li>Updates with the simplified Debian software center (<a
href="#software-upgrading-your-applications">chap.8.3.4</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h3 data-number="6.3.1" id="update-with-a-terminal"><span
class="header-section-number">6.3.1</span> Update with a terminal</h3>
<p>The terminal, this little box which frightens you so much, whereas it
is actually your friend … yes, yes … your friend.</p>
<p>You want a proof ? Easy: we are going to update the entire system
using just one line.</p>
<p>You start by opening a terminal window (usually under the menu
“System” of your environment).</p>
<p>If during the Debian install, both the “root” account and a “normal”
user account (for the common use of the system) were created, you have
to use the command “su -” in order to execute a command in administrator
mode, when the session was open by the “normal” user. The super-user
password is then requested.</p>
<pre><code>user@debian-pc:~$ su -
Password:
root@debian-pc:~# apt update &amp;&amp; apt full-upgrade</code></pre>
<p>On the other end, if during the Debian install, the super-user
account was disabled (no password was entered) , the “normal” user has
the opportunity to gain the super-user privileges by using the “sudo”
command. When using sudo, <strong>your own password</strong> is
requested.</p>
<pre><code>user@debian-pc:~$ sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt full-upgrade
Password:</code></pre>
<p><img src="img/misc/noob-info.png#left" /><br />
<strong>… wait a minute, what does that mean exactly?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>“sudo”: allows you to take the super-user role ;</li>
<li>“apt”: the command to invoke the Debian package manager ;</li>
<li>“update”: reload the information concerning the available packages
;</li>
<li>“&amp;&amp;”: once this is done without error, launch what follows
;</li>
<li>“apt”: the same application verifies and applies the modifications
;</li>
<li>“full-upgrade”: execute a complete update of the installed
applications, adding or removing packages as necessary. A confirmation
to proceed will be requested. For a complete example have a look on the
Administrator example (<a
href="#administrator-mode-example">chap.3.8.3</a>).</li>
</ul>
<h3 data-number="6.3.2" id="updates-notification"><span
class="header-section-number">6.3.2</span> Updates notification</h3>
<p>The GNU/Linux desktops use <strong>Software</strong> or the
<strong>Synaptic package manager</strong> on the Gnome, Xfce and LXDE
interfaces, or <strong>Discover</strong> on the KDE interface, and both
tools include a <strong>notification</strong> function.<br />
Thus, your system checks the repositories on a regular basis (when the
network is available, of course), without even bothering you, and
displays a notification at the beginning of a new session when some
updates are available. It is enough to accept the updates, or to click
on the notification bubble opening up, to display the update manager
tool integrated in your system.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/06-start/30-kde-update-notify.jpg"
alt="Update notification on the KDE interface" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Update notification on the KDE
interface</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If you want to <strong>manually check</strong> for available updates,
you can use the terminal and the magic command <strong>apt
update</strong> in administrator mode:</p>
<pre><code>user@debian:~$ su -
Password:
root@debian:~# apt update</code></pre>
<h2 data-number="6.4" id="retrieve-your-email-account"><span
class="header-section-number">6.4</span> Retrieve your email
account</h2>
<p><img src="img/apps/mail.png#left" /><br />
If you have an <strong>online messaging service</strong> like gmail.com
or free.fr, you can access it from your Firefox web browser (launches
from the application menus in the “Internet” section). Enter the address
of your online account provider (openmailbox.org, yahoo.fr, orange.fr,
google.com …) in the address bar and launch it by pressing [Enter].</p>
<p>If you do not have an e-mail account, or if you want to create a new
e-mail account, we recommend that you use one of the services that
respect your privacy. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://proton.me">https://protonmail.com</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.mailo.com">https://www.mailo.com</a></li>

<p>If you want to use a <strong>local e-mail client</strong>, a
dedicated software, Debian offers several tools, but all working on the
same model: Gnome uses “Evolution”, KDE includes “KMail” and Xfce
integrates <strong>Thunderbird</strong>.</p>
<h3 data-number="6.4.1" id="thunderbird-your-free-mail-client"><span
class="header-section-number">6.4.1</span> Thunderbird: your free mail
client <img src="img/logo/thunderbird.png" /></h3>
<p><strong>Thunderbird</strong> (<a
href="https://www.thunderbird.net/">https://www.thunderbird.net/</a>) is
primarily an <strong>emailer</strong>, but it is also a communication
hub that allows you to read and write within newsgroups, chat with
others (discussion group), and read RSS feeds provided by some
websites.</p>
<p>If you have two or more email accounts, it might not be very
practical to access each of them using the browser! Thunderbird is an
application that brings together all the mail boxes of all your email
accounts, in one single convenient interface.</p>
<p>To open Thunderbird, from an application list or a menu, select the
“Mail client” from the “Internet” category.</p>
<h4 data-number="6.4.1.1" id="thunderbird-setup"><span
class="header-section-number">6.4.1.1</span> Thunderbird setup</h4>
<p>At first startup, <strong>Thunderbird</strong> provides temporary
configuration interface and a foreground window that allows you to
create an account with two suppliers and partners.</p>
<p>If you want to take advantage of this option, fill the fields in and
let you be guided, this configuration is automatic.</p>
<p>If you are not interested, you can click on “Skip this step and use
my existing address”.</p>
<p>Another window opens. Then provide the requested information about
your account. You can choose whether Thunderbird must remember the
password. If you leave this option unchecked, you would need to re-enter
your password each time you connect.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/06-start/31-thunderbird-1.jpg"
alt="Thunderbird: mail account configuration" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Thunderbird: mail account

<img src="img/06-start/32-thunderbird-2.jpg"
alt="Thunderbird: mail account verification" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Thunderbird: mail account

<p>Thunderbird now displays your account details in the right column,
starts downloading all your emails and, depending on your provider, all
your contacts (this may take sometime).</p>
<h4 data-number="6.4.1.2" id="thunderbird-interface"><span

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Thunderbird: default display</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The Thunderbird interface is relatively intuitive. In the top tool
bar you can check your mail, compose a new message, open a chat session,
access your address book, put a label on a message, or filter your
messages.<br />
At the right of the menu bar you can find the Thunderbird menu,
represented by three small horizontal bars, from which you can set your
preferences, and launch various actions.<br />
For example if you click on the Message menu (or right-click on a given
message), a list of actions is proposed, like Reply, Forward, Archive,
Mark as Junk, etc.</p>
<p>The right panel is reserved for the “Lightning” calendar, very
intuitive: a click on a date will open the assistant to make new
appointments.</p>
<p>If you are <strong>looking for a specific message</strong> you have
several options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Type few characters in the search field of the top menu bar;</li>
<li>Click on one of the column headers (“Subject”, “From”, “Date”,
“Attachments”, “Star”, “Tag” if you tag your messages, Read/Unread
status, etc.): your messages will be sorted immediately according to the
selected criterion (defined by the header name), which will let you find
quickly an old message rather than scrolling through an endless list of
emails. By clicking a second time on the column header the sort will be
done in reverse order. Thus, by using this tool, you can customize the
way your messages are presented according to your own criteria.</li>
</ul>
<h4 data-number="6.4.1.3" id="retrieve-other-email-accounts"><span
class="header-section-number">6.4.1.3</span> Retrieve other email
account(s)</h4>
<p>If you have more email accounts you want to access via Thunderbird,
click on the main menu (the three small horizontal bars at the right of
the tool bar) and select “New Message” &gt; “Existing Mail Account …”
and continue the Mail Account Setup procedure like explained above.</p>
<h4 data-number="6.4.1.4" id="thunderbird-settings"><span
class="header-section-number">6.4.1.4</span> Thunderbird settings</h4>
<p>In the modern presentation of Thunderbird (as well as other
communication tools like Firefox and Chromium, for example) the
application menu is defined by three small horizontal bars (sometime
called “burger menu”) at the top right of the window. From this menu you
have access to the various parameters of the application.<br />
If you prefer the classic presentation, with the menu bar at the top of
the window, click on this Thunderbird menu, then on “Preferences” and
tick the “Menu Bar” on.</p>
<p>It is advisable to visit the Preferences setting window, where you
can define the handling of junk mails, define a master password for all
your account, customize your tag list, among all the settings available
in there.</p>

<p><img src="img/misc/noob-info.png#left" /><br />
<strong>… Encrypt your e-mails … what does that mean?</strong><br />
Let us take the example of the regular mail, sent via post-mail. You
send a postcard to your mother-in-law for example, you know that what is
written on it can be read by the postman or anyone else. Well, with your
e-mails, it’s exactly like the postcard, if you do not encrypt them.</p>
<p>“<em>Does not matter</em>” you say, “<em>I don’t care if someone
knows that I wrote to my mother-in-law that the weather is fine during
our vacations</em>”. Perhaps. But you can write more than just mundane
wordings in your messages, and you never know what can happen to them.
You are not convinced? I ask you to reconsider if you really have
nothing to hide by visiting this page on the <strong>FSF</strong>
website: <a

<p>GNU/Linux systems follow the principle of rights and permissions by
default. When you install Debian, a password is requested for the
primary user. This password is requested at the beginning of the
session.</p>
<p>If you are using Debian in single-user mode, you can disable this
password request in order to begin your working session directly when
the computer is started.<br />
Debian uses three different default connection managers:
<strong>GDM</strong> (on Gnome &amp; Cinnamon), <strong>LightDM</strong>

<p>You can setup <strong>LightDM</strong> (<a
href="https://wiki.debian.org/LightDM">https://wiki.debian.org/LightDM</a>)
by editing its main configuration file. To enable autologin, you’ll have
to edit it with a terminal. Open a terminal and become root with the
“<strong>su</strong>” command (<a
href="#administrator-mode-example">chap.3.8.3</a>). The administrator
password will be asked. Once connected to a root terminal, copy (to
backup) and edit the dedicated file with this 2 commands:</p>
<pre><code>cp /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf.bak
nano /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf</code></pre>
<p>The second command opens the configuration file in the CLI
<strong>Nano</strong> editor. Use arrows to scroll and locate those
lines:</p>
<pre><code>#autologin-user=
#autologin-user-timeout=0</code></pre>
<p>Remove the “#” (uncomment) in front of each line then add your login
like this:</p>
<pre><code>autologin-user=my_login
autologin-user-timeout=0</code></pre>
<p>Where “my_login” should be replaced by <strong>your
login</strong>.</p>
<p>Save the file with the [Ctrl]+x shortcut, then answer “Y” for
“yes”:</p>

The primary function of a web browser is to let you consult information
available on the Web (World Wide Web). The user gives the browser the
web address of the resource to consult. There are three ways to provide
a web address:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Type yourself the web address</strong> in the address bar of
the browser,</li>
<li>Select a entry in your <strong>list of bookmarks</strong>,</li>
<li><strong>Follow a link</strong> on a web page, knowing that each link
is associated with a web address.</li>
</ul>
<p>The browser connects to the web server hosting the target resource.
The communication protocol commonly used is HTTP or HTTPS (its secure
version).</p>
<ul>
<li>If the resource is an HTML page, a compatible video file, or a PDF
file, the browser display the page.</li>
<li>If the resource is unknown or not handled by the browser, the choice
is yours: download or open the resource with an external
application.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Firefox</strong> (<a
href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/</a>)
is an open and free web browser, developed and distributed by the
<strong>Mozilla Foundation</strong> (<a
href="https://www.mozilla.org">https://www.mozilla.org</a>) with the
help of thousands of volunteers using the free software/open source
development methodology (according to <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox">wikipedia</a>).</p>
<p>Debian integrates <strong>Firefox-ESR</strong>, the
“<strong>E</strong>xtended <strong>S</strong>upport
<strong>R</strong>elease” version, aimed at large organizations (and
small ones) for mass deployments. This version is maintained for 10
months from its release date and only benefits from security updates,
ensuring a stable and secure browser.</p>
<p>The main window consists of the following elements (from top to
bottom):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The tab bar</strong> displays the open Internet pages and
allows you to switch from one to another with a single click.</li>
<li><strong>The tools bar</strong> displays: the backward and forward
buttons, the address bar, the search field, the bookmark button, the
main Firefox menu.</li>
<li><strong>the browsing pane</strong> displays the web pages
contents.</li>
</ul>
<figure>
<img src="img/06-start/45-firefox.jpg" alt="Firefox on Debian" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Firefox on Debian</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>Customize and configure</strong> Firefox through its main
menu that appears when clicking on the “burger” icon (at the right end
of the tool bar):</p>
<ul>
<li>The first line of the menu <strong>“Sync and save data”</strong>
allows you, if you have previously created a Firefox account, to
synchronize your data (like your bookmarks, history, passwords, open
tabs and add-ons installed) on all your different devices.</li>
<li><strong>“New Tab”</strong> opens a tab in the active firefox
window.</li>
<li><strong>“New Window”</strong> opens a 2nd window with the Firefox
browser.</li>
<li><strong>“New Private Window”</strong> will open a 2nd window but
this time, passwords, cookies and history will be automatically deleted,
leaving no trace at the end of the session.</li>
<li><strong>“Bookmarks”</strong> allows you to consult and manage your
favorite websites.</li>
<li><strong>“History”</strong> allows you to consult and manage your
surf history.</li>
<li><strong>“Downloads”</strong> allows you to consult and manage your
downloads history.</li>
<li><strong>“Passwords”</strong> allows direct access to parameters
related to passwords saved in Firefox (about:preferences#privacy).</li>
<li>The <strong>Add-ons and themes</strong> button takes you to the
extensions configuration menu (active or inactive) as well as the look
of your firefox browser.</li>
<li><strong>“Print”</strong> opens the print preview window.</li>
<li><strong>“Save Page As”</strong> will help you to copy on your hard
disk, in a directory specified, the active web page in Firefox.</li>
<li><strong>“Find in page…”</strong> allows you to search and find a
word in the current page through the <em>searchbar</em>.</li>
<li>Then comes the <strong>Zoom line</strong>… it’s explicit.</li>
<li>The <strong>Settings</strong> button takes you to the main
configuration tab.</li>
<li>The <strong>More tools</strong> button launches some functions as
the “edit mode” of Firefox: the top panel presents “Additional Tools and
Features” that you can move either to the Firefox main menu (currently
open) or directly into the tool bar, and vice versa … Well, you tweak
the look of the browser by just dragging and dropping items in the
interface. When you are done click on “Exit Customize” at the bottom of
the main menu. You would find the task manager as well, which indicates
the memory used by the various open web pages and your extensions.</li>
<li>The “<strong>Help</strong>” button takes you to the official Firefox
on-line help. Mozilla contributors did work very well. The online help
(<a
href="https://support.mozilla.org/en/products/firefox">https://support.mozilla.org/en/products/firefox</a>)
is comprehensive and detailed: you can explore in there all your browser
capabilities.</li>
</ul>
<p>To add new features to your Firefox browser, navigate to the main
menu &gt; Add-ons and themes. In the tab that opens, select “Get
Add-ons” and choose from the available modules (<a

<p><img src="img/apps/video.png#left" /><br />
Once your system is installed (or in Live session), a double-click on a
video file will open it with the default player of your DE. For Gnome or
Cinnamon, it is the “Videos” player (Totem) which is automatically
launched when double-clicking on a video:</p>

</figure>
<p>Its use is very simple and intuitive. At the slightest movement of
the pointer, the playback menu is displayed and allows you to browse the
video file, set loop playback (the vertical bar formed by 3 points) or
adjust the volume. The main menu gives you access to other
functions.</p>
<p>Each DE integrates its own player, all featuring the same basic
functions, largely enough for a first use of a Debian system.</p>
<p>The Xfce desktop comes with a multi-platform media player widely used
by Windows®: <strong>VLC</strong> (<a

various broadcasted protocols.</p>
<p>As usual on Debian, you can add the multimedia software of your
choice. I’ll let you visit the list of applications available on the

Debian GNU/Linux comes with a media player for each DE. Some allow the
management of a large music collection, including sort management, play
lists, cover artwork, etc (such as Amarok or Rhythmbox described in the
following section), others are simple, lightweight and easy to master
(Such as Audacious <a

<p>Debian recognizes (among other things) the 4 main default formats
(mp3, ogg, flac, wav). If you need to install codecs or non-free audio
software, you will need to modify your repositories (<a
href="#modifying-the-repositories">chap.8.1.4</a>) to add the “contrib”
and “non-free” sections.</p>
<h3 data-number="6.8.2" id="rhythmbox-your-music-player"><span

player</h3>
<p><strong>Rhythmbox</strong> (<a
href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Rhythmbox">https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Rhythmbox</a>)
is the default music player in the Gnome environment, which allows you
to play and organize your music collection.</p>
<p>Here are its main features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sort by artists, albums or genres.</li>
<li>Playlist management.</li>
<li>Display of jackets and lyrics.</li>
<li>Management of podcasts and web-radios.</li>
<li>Integration of <a href="https://libre.fm/">Libre.fm</a> and <a
href="https://www.last.fm">Last.fm</a>.</li>
<li>Support for portable players (MTP or iPod).</li>
<li>Support infrared remote controls.</li>
<li>Sharing and playing music on a local network.</li>
</ul>
<p>At first launch, Rhythmbox scans your “Music” folder, but you can add
more folders to your music library.</p>

<p>The main desktops also have their own dedicated player, which works
with the same principle: a music library scanned by the application
which then offers you to play a single record or a full “playlists”,
options, preferences and plugins.<br />
Let your mouse wander, you do not risk anything: a confirmation will be
asked for each action involving the modification or the deletion of your
musical files.</p>

<strong>P</strong>rogram, is an image processing software. Often
considered as a competitor of Adobe™ photoshop™, it is, at any rate, a

it is free!</p>
<p>Available for a whole range of OS, it runs obviously on Linux,
MacOsX, BSD and Windows®.</p>

(bottom right).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The toolbox</strong> contains the icons for the various Gimp
tools. You can add or remove them from the menu bar &gt; Edit &gt;
Preferences &gt; Toolbox. The function of each tool is displayed on a
pop-up window, if selected.</li>
<li><strong>The tool options</strong> displays the parameter values of
the tool currently used: the size and hardness of the brush, for
example, or the opacity of the filling color…</li>
<li><strong>The menu bar</strong> gives you access to all functions and
features of the Gimp.</li>
<li><strong>The active image</strong> is displayed in the main window:
the changes made are directly visible.</li>
<li>The right window contains various tabs that you can modify or mask
by clicking on the small arrow at the top right of the tab.</li>
</ul>
<p>By default, the first tab displays the active layers in the
image.</p>
<p><img src="img/misc/noob-info.png#left" /><br />
<strong>… What do those “layers” exactly mean??</strong><br />
<strong>Gimp uses the principle of layers</strong>, ie the
superimposition of images for a final rendering. It is the same
principle as when recording a piece of music: the instruments are all
recorded on separate “audio tracks”, and the voices also; then they are
“mixed” all together to obtain the final piece of music.<br />
For the layers of Gimp, it is the same principle: you separate the
different elements on layers and the final image is assembled and
exported in the format of your choice (JPEG, PNG …).</p>
<p><strong>The default format of Gimp is “xcf”</strong>, a format that
preserves the independence of the different layers and thus enable
modifying one element without touching the other layers.</p>
<h3 data-number="6.10.2" id="first-tips"><span
class="header-section-number">6.10.2</span> First Tips</h3>
<p><strong>Prepare a folder with a copy of the images to be
modified:</strong></p>
<p>It is often said, <strong>the backup is your friend</strong> and it
is also true for image editing. Before working on your project, create a
folder where you will place a copy of your original image as well as all
the elements you want to add (other images to process, modify, your
graphics resources in short).</p>
<p><strong>Record your work regularly in “.xcf” format:</strong></p>
<p>Gimp uses the default “xcf” format to save your project. This format
allows to save the layers and therefore, permits a fine modification of
your work. <strong>To save</strong> in xcf format, direction the menu
“File”&gt; “Save”. Once your project is finalized, you can
<strong>export your project</strong> in a compressed format (jpeg, png,
gif) from the menu bar: “File” &gt; “Export as”.</p>
<p><strong>Have Fun!</strong> <img src="img/logo/wilber-eeek.png" /></p>
<p>One way to discover <strong>the Gimp</strong> is to test it, try it,
and have fun editing your family pictures … Create a folder to play with
Gimp and place your favorite photos or images and start to
<em>gimp-it</em></p>
<p><strong>Tutorials</strong> <img
src="img/logo/wilber-reading.png" /></p>
<p>The Gimp website provides a large choice of tutorials where you could
learn how to start playinf with it: <a
href="https://www.gimp.org/tutorials/">https://www.gimp.org/tutorials/</a></p>
<p><strong>Print an image</strong></p>
<p>If Gimp prints only white pages, and the preview is desperately
showing a blank page too; but you can fix this problem by installing the
gimp-gutenprint package in administrator mode (<a
href="#administrator-mode-example">chap.3.8.3</a>):</p>
<pre><code>apt install gimp-gutenprint</code></pre>
<p>Then, to print a image, all you have to do is: “File &gt; Print with
Gutenprint”. A page is open where you can set up your printer and your
desired print layout.</p>
<p><strong>What about kids?</strong></p>
<p>Debian has thought of you and offers in its repositories the

<p>Do you feel that you took control of your system ? Now we are going
to tweak the configuration of your workstation.</p>
<p>Basically, you can modify everything you want on the Debian GNU/Linux
desktops and tailor your environment to make it fit your personal needs
and tastes.</p>
<p>To achieve this, the right-click is the <em>quasi-ultimate</em>
weapon ! <img src="img/mouse/clic-droit.png" /></p>
<h2 data-number="7.1" id="user-interface"><span
class="header-section-number">7.1</span> User interface</h2>
<p><img src="img/apps/skin.png#left" /><br />
The GNU/Linux environments are known for their great flexibility in
terms of configuration. However, some desktop are more flexible than
others, because of their main interface.</p>
<p>Grossly speaking, they all work the same way: a “Control Center” to
handle almost<br />
all parameters in the same place, and the right-click for the settings
of individual elements.</p>
<p>Most of the functionalities have been addressed during the
presentation of the desktops (<a
href="#choosing-your-gnulinux-desktop">chap.4.2</a>). But let’s go back
to the two main Debian desktops: Gnome and KDE.</p>
<h3 data-number="7.1.1" id="the-gnome-shell-interface"><span

<p><strong>Gnome is the default desktop</strong> for the Debian

makes it a fluid and intuitive environment.</p>
<p>Gnome-Shell (<a
href="https://wiki.debian.org/GnomeShell">https://wiki.debian.org/GnomeShell</a>)
provides a “uniform” interface: this is what brings this great fluidity.
This means also that you will not be able to modify everything you want,
like on the other desktops built with a modular design. But instead of
talking about the few things you cannot make, let’s talk about all the
settings directly available to you.</p>
<p>Let’s take the direction Gnome Activity menu &gt; “Tweaks”.</p>

is modular, movable, configurable, and accessible from a very detailed
<strong>System Setting Center</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>KDE</strong> allows you to build your environment from A to
Z, down to the last detail. Some would argue that it is (too) complete,
and we cannot hide that there is a small rivalry between KDE users and
those using <em>The</em> Gnome environment. <img

The configuration of your system directly impact you user experience.
Instead of writing a complete chapter about the different ethical and
technical concepts which led to the Debian software organization, we are
going to examine their consequences on your daily usage.</p>
<p>In the rest of this chapter, you might be asked to activate the
“contrib” and/or “non-free” sections of the Debian repositories, in
order to access some “less-free” software. In that case, follow the
method documented in the <a href="#modifying-the-repositories">chapter
8.1.4</a>.</p>
<h3 data-number="7.2.1" id="root-user-su-sudo"><span
class="header-section-number">7.2.1</span> Root-User / su-sudo</h3>
<p>During the installation, Debian ask you to enter the password for the
“root” administrator account. This account is common to all the
GNU/Linux systems and allows to execute administrative tasks on the
system.</p>
<p>However, this account is not mandatory. During the installation
process, you can pass over the “root” account configuration (by leaving
empty the root password fields), and doing so, avoid its creation.</p>
<p>In this case, this is the <em>first user</em> registered during the
installation who will assume the “root” role.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>OK… and then?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then, this changes the way you launch commands to administrate the
system: in this manual, every time we ask you to execute a command in
“root” mode, we use the “<strong>su</strong>” command. But if the “root”
account was not created, you must use instead the
“<strong>sudo</strong>” command, which promotes you as “root”, and type
<strong>your own password</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>In a nutshell</strong> to launch an administrative
command:<br />
<strong>If the “root” account was created</strong>, use “su” +
administrator password + command launch:</p>
<pre><code>su
&gt; asking administrative password
apt update &amp;&amp; apt upgrade
&gt; command execution</code></pre>
<p><strong>If the “root” account was <em>NOT</em> created</strong>, use
“sudo + command” + your user password:</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt upgrade
&gt; asking first user password
&gt; command execution</code></pre>
<h3 data-number="7.2.2" id="playing-a-commercial-dvd"><span
class="header-section-number">7.2.2</span> Playing a commercial DVD</h3>
<p>The DVDs sold commercially are “copy protected” and usually are not
readable by default on free systems.</p>
<p>The Entertaining Companies consider that we do not have the right, on
a free system, to make a private copy of the DVDs we bought … no
comment.</p>
<p>To remedy that, if you really need this functionality, you must
install the <strong>libdvdcss2</strong> package. This package is not
present by default in the Debian repositories, but can be easily
installed via the <em>libdvd-pkg</em>. To install libdvd-pkg, remember
to activate the “contrib” repository. Within a terminal in adminstrator
mode:</p>
<pre><code>apt install libdvd-pkg &amp;&amp; dpkg-reconfigure libdvd-pkg</code></pre>
<p>Your Debian GNU/Linux system is now able to read the “protected”
commercial DVDs, and to make private copies of them.</p>
<h3 data-number="7.2.3" id="installing-a-graphic-card-driver"><span
class="header-section-number">7.2.3</span> Installing a graphic card
driver</h3>
<p>The Debian GNU/Linux system includes free drivers and some firmware
in order to operate the integrated graphical functions (chipsets) of the
motherboard or the external graphical card.</p>
<p>Since version 12 “Bookworm”, Debian has included a series of non-free
firmware by default in order to make it easier to recognize your
hardware.<br />
Installing a proprietary driver therefore becomes less and less
necessary.</p>
<p><img src="img/misc/noob-info.png#left" /><br />
<strong>… I need a driver to manage the card of my mother
??</strong><br />
Your computer is designed around its “motherboard”, a plastic board on
which the various elements of the processor (the central compute unit)
are fixed, as well as the chipset, the graphical component being part of
them (the graphical display computer, to make a long story short).<br />
In order to send the right instructions to these elements the GNU/Linux
kernel (the program managing the interactions between the hardware and
the the system) uses pieces of code, called drivers (and sometimes also
“firmware” to be loaded on smart devices during the initialization
phase). The Linux kernel includes by default a set of free drivers.
These drivers are usually sufficient to manage the screen display. But
it may happen that proprietary drivers are still needed, for example to
optimize the screen resolution.</p>
<p>You can try to install these proprietary drivers if, during a live
session or once your system is installed, you find out that:</p>
<ul>
<li>resolution is wrong, with stretched and distorted images,</li>
<li>the screen remains black after start-up, even if the system was
installed without any errors,</li>
<li>the colors are badly handled,</li>
<li>the system is heating too much when watching videos,</li>
<li>returning from the “suspend” mode is somewhat erratic …</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that installing proprietary drivers is a non-free
alternative, and as such, not followed by the Debian developers. If your
computer is very recent, don’t hesitate to ask the support of the
community before tinkering with your system (<a
href="#where-to-find-help">chap.1.2</a>).</p>
<h4 data-number="7.2.3.1" id="graphics-session-loss"><span
class="header-section-number">7.2.3.1</span> Graphics Session Loss</h4>
<p>If, following a driver installation, you are facing a black screen,
you need to restore the previous configuration … <strong>Undo</strong>
the modifs.<br />
At the login prompt, you need to type your username and password
(likewise a graphic session) and then restart cleanly your computer with
the “systemctl reboot” command.</p>
<p><strong>Boot in “recovery mode”</strong>: from the Grub loader menu,
select the “Advanced options” entry and then the “recovery mode”
entry.</p>

<p>The system launches a console and invites you to continue the startup
sequence (by using the [Ctrl]+d short-cut to quit the console) or to
enter the administrator password for maintenance, and this is what you
do:</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/07-conf/22-recovery-3.jpg" alt="recovery mode enabled" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">recovery mode enabled</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>Recovery mode failed</strong>:<br />
If you did not configure a “root” account during installation (<a
href="#administrator-mode-example">chap.3.8.3</a>) recovery mode cannot
be activated because it needs the “root” account and its password. You
will see this screen:</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/07-conf/23-recovery-fail.jpg"
alt="Recovery mode failed" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Recovery mode failed</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>To solve this problem, just add a “root” account with its password.
That’s good, you have the rights to do it, thanks to “sudo”. In your
console, log in as a simple user with your password then start creating
the “root” password:</p>
<pre><code>user@debian-pc:~$ sudo passwd root
[sudo] Password for user:</code></pre>
<p>You are asked for <strong>your password</strong>. Then you fill in
the new password for “root”:</p>
<pre><code>New password:
Retype the new password:</code></pre>
<p>And that’s it, the “root” account is now activated, you can start
again the operation and enter “recovery mode”.</p>
<p><strong>Removal of the xorg.conf configuration file</strong>: during
the installation of the proprietary driver, you created an X
configuration file located in /etc/X11/xorg.conf and/or in
/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/xxx.conf. It must be removed. Always within the
console and depending on the file created, remove it with the command:
“<strong>rm</strong>” (Here the file corresponding to
<strong>nVidia</strong> which was removed, <strong>!! to be tailored to
your situation !!</strong>):</p>
<pre><code>rm /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-nvidia.conf</code></pre>
<p><strong>Uninstall the proprietary drivers</strong>: the same way you
were able to install a driver, you can uninstall it, here after an
example with the nVidia driver, <strong>!! to be tailored to your
situation !!</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>apt remove nvidia-kernel-dkms nvidia-driver</code></pre>
<p><strong>Restart your computer</strong> with a simple:</p>
<pre><code>systemctl reboot</code></pre>

It will be readable by you (you can consult the data of the other user)

<ul>
<li>“deb”: means a <em>binary</em> repository (the compiled software

<li>“deb-src”: means a <em>source</em> repository (the program code
files used to compile the software)</li>
<li>“http:…” or “https:…”: the Internet address of the repository

<strong>… why “bookworm” and not “stable” since the system is based on
Debian Stable ??</strong><br />
“<strong>bookworm</strong>” is the precise version name of the installed
system. It sets a given version of each packages included in the
“bookworm” repository (the version of the generic kernel, for
example).<br />
“<strong>stable</strong>” is the generic name of the <em>currently</em>
stable version.<br />
For the time being, Debian 12 “bookworm” is the “stable” version, thus
you could used either designation. But when the Debian “stable” version
becomes Debian 13 “Trixie”, then Debian 12 “bookworm” attribute will
change to “oldstable”.</p>
<p>Using the precise name of your version allows you to control
<strong>if and when</strong> you want to upgrade your system to the next
version, as opposed to some systems which want to impose their
upgrades…<br />

<li><strong>main</strong>: complies to the DFSG without any “non-free”
dependency</li>
<li><strong>non-free-firmware</strong>: non-free firmwares included by
default since Debian 12</li>
<li><strong>contrib</strong>: complies to the DFSG with some “non-free”
dependencies</li>
<li><strong>non-free</strong>: does not comply to the DFSG</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>DFSG</strong> (<strong>D</strong>ebian <strong>F</strong>ree
<strong>S</strong>oftware <strong>G</strong>uidelines): philosophical
principles of the “libre software” according to Debian (<a
href="https://www.debian.org/social_contract.html#guidelines">https://www.debian.org/social_contract.html#guidelines</a>).</p>
<p>Only the packages within the <strong>main</strong> section/component
are officially supported by the Debian project and are 100% free
software. Rather, those proposed in <em>contrib</em>, <em>non-free</em>
and <em>non-free-firmware</em> are partially or totally non-free.</p>
<p>Having said that, and depending on your type of hardware, it is very
possible that some services won’t function correctly without using some
specific (proprietary) drivers. In that case, you need to modify the
/etc/apt/sources.list file (details in the following chapter).</p>

<h3 data-number="8.1.3" id="backport-packages"><span
class="header-section-number">8.1.3</span> Backport packages</h3>
<p>Debian offers also some special repositories called
<strong>backports</strong>, which contain <strong>more recent
versions</strong> of some applications. These repositories are not
activated by default, but do not present any particular risks for your
system: <strong>the “regular” repositories have the highest priority
during the update process</strong>, only the applications installed from
the backports will look into these specific repositories.</p>
<p><img src="img/misc/noob-info.png#left" /><br />
<strong>… what do you mean exactly by “backports” ?</strong><br />
Nothing to do, in fact, with the “backdoors” used to spy on computers
running proprietary systems…<br />
The <strong>backport</strong> is a mechanism allowing an application
currently hold in the Debian development repositories, to be <em>ported
back</em> to the “stable” version.<br />
For example, the Debian developers take from the development
repositories the most recent version of LibreOffice, and re-compile
(re-build) the package holding the application, while taking care of all
the dependencies existing in the “stable” version.</p>
<p>More details about <em>Backports</em> in the dedicated page of the
Debian wiki (<a
href="https://wiki.debian.org/Backports">https://wiki.debian.org/Backports</a>).</p>
<p>If you are looking for specific application, you have two
solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>use the search package tool (<a
href="https://backports.debian.org/Packages/">https://backports.debian.org/Packages/</a>)</li>
<li>use the search by category (<a
href="https://packages.debian.org/bookworm-backports/">https://packages.debian.org/bookworm-backports/</a>).</li>
</ul>
<h3 data-number="8.1.4" id="modifying-the-repositories"><span
class="header-section-number">8.1.4</span> Modifying the
Repositories</h3>
<p>Before you start modifying the software sources of your system, you
must be conscious of the risks your are taking by using the “contrib” or
“non-free” components of the archived branch :</p>
<ul>
<li>the lack of freedom for this kind of packages</li>
<li>the lack of support by the Debian project (you cannot maintain a
piece of software without having the source code at your disposal)</li>
<li>the contamination of your completely free Debian system.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, that you are aware that the non-free people kill the pink
rabbits, let’s move on:</p>
<p>To modify your software sources, it is enough to edit the
‘sources.list’ file. Open a terminal in administrator mode (<a
href="#administrator-mode-example">chap.3.8.3</a>), and enter:</p>
<pre><code>apt edit-sources</code></pre>
<p>This command opens the appropriate file with the default text editor
(nano or vim). Once you are done with your modifications, save the file
(“[Ctrl]+x” with nano, or “:wq” with vim <a
href="https://www.vim.org/">https://www.vim.org/</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Example of line entry for the free packages:</strong></p>
<pre><code>deb http://deb.debian.org/debian/ bookworm main</code></pre>
<p><strong>Example of line entry for the free packages and the
proprietary packages:</strong></p>
<pre><code>deb http://deb.debian.org/debian/ bookworm main contrib non-free non-free-firmware</code></pre>
<p>Now you can pick in the 4 package sections and install the non-free
codecs and drivers.</p>
<p>Note that you can also modify your software sources by using the
graphical Synaptic package manager (<a
href="#synaptic-the-comprehensive-package-manager">chap.8.3</a>).</p>

The following sections present the basic commands to manage de Debian

<p>Debian supports also “aptitude”, another package manager, with a
different syntax and behavior. This manual being intended for beginners,

its numerous functionalities.<br />
Don’t be afraid to break your system since nothing will really happen
until you click on the “Apply” button. On top of that, a message asking
for confirmation will always be displayed first.</p>
<p><strong>The very first thing to do</strong> when you launch Synaptic,
is to <strong>click on the “Reload” button</strong> in order to update

<li><strong>General</strong>: the options in there are rather explicit.
Note: it is possible to un-check the option “Consider recommended
packages as dependencies”, if that helps you keeping an ultra-light
system. But this could induce problems when installing future new
packages. Thus an option to be handled carefully.</li>
<li><strong>Columns and Fonts</strong>: allows you to display/mask some
columns in the package list, and define the font, if necessary.</li>
<li><strong>Colors</strong>: you can define here the package colors
according to their status.</li>
<li><strong>Files</strong>: When you install a piece of software, it is
first stored in the <em>cache</em> (which is a specific folder of the
file system) before being uncompressed and installed. These packages can
occupy more and more disk space as you make usage of your computer. Here
you can delete them immediately or configure an automatic action.</li>
<li><strong>Network</strong>: This is the way Synaptic connects to
Internet. You should know if your situation requires a modification of
these parameters.</li>

<p><strong>Apt</strong>/aptitude/dpkg are the usual Debian package
managers. When you install a package its archive-source/deb file is
stored in your system (in the /var/cache/apt/archives/ folder) to enable
a potential re-installation without Internet connection. To clean the
“apt cache” use a simple command in administrator mode (<a
href="#administrator-mode-example">chap.3.8.3</a>):</p>
<pre><code>apt clean</code></pre>
<p>Once the cache of the installed packages is cleaned, you can also
remove the useless packages from your system, as well as the
configuration files. <strong>Warning!</strong> Remember to check
carefully the list of the packages planed for removal, before accepting
the operation:</p>
<pre><code>apt autoremove --purge</code></pre>
<p>If you have upgraded your system, it is possible that some packages
are no longer available on the new repositories: they are obsolete. To
list and remove these packages, use <strong>apt</strong> and remember
<strong>to check carefully</strong> the list of packages planed for
removal:</p>
<pre><code>apt list &#39;?obsolete&#39;
apt remove &#39;?obsolete&#39;</code></pre>
<p>Finally, to list and purge configuration files that have remained in
place despite the removal of applications, you can use these
commands:</p>
<pre><code>dpkg --list | awk &#39;/^rc/ {print $2}&#39;
apt purge $(dpkg --list | awk &#39;/^rc/ {print $2}&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>For the more maniac, you can install the deborphan tool which lists
the orphaned packages on your system: those that no other package
depends on. <strong>Warning!</strong> Remember to check carefully the
list of the packages planed for removal, before accepting the
operation.</p>
<pre><code>apt install deborphan                # install deborphan

<p>Three different trash-bins (or wastebaskets) must be taken into
account:</p>
<p><strong>The user wastebasket</strong>: <em>~/.local/share/Trash/</em>
You can empty it with the system file manager (<a
href="#data-removal">chap.3.6.2.5</a>), or with a terminal:</p>
<pre><code>rm -Rf ~/.local/share/Trash/*</code></pre>
<p><strong>The administrator wastebasket</strong>:
<em>/root/.local/share/Trash/</em> To empty it with the proper manner,
use a terminal in administrator mode:</p>
<pre><code>rm -Rf /root/.local/share/Trash/*</code></pre>
<p><strong>The external wastebaskets</strong>: locates on your external
datas storage, they are usually named
‘/media/your_id/your_disk/.Trash_1000’, where your_id corresponds to
your login name.</p>
<h3 data-number="8.6.4" id="purging-application-caches"><span
class="header-section-number">8.6.4</span> Purging application
caches</h3>
<p>Some applications use a “cache” folder, where they store images,
videos, and miscellaneous information in order to run faster. Usually
these data do not occupy too much disk space, however if (using the
tools described above) you detect that a folder becomes too fat, don’t
hesitate to remove it.</p>
<pre><code>rm -Rf ~/.cache/*</code></pre>
<p>Each application has its own way to manage its own cache: some purge
it systematically when they close, others store their data in the /tmp
folder, which will be cleared during the session logout, others keep all
their information in a specific folder.</p>
<p>For Firefox, as an example, you can purge the cache from the
preferences menu, and even automate this action every time the
application is closed.</p>
<h3 data-number="8.6.5" id="purging-the-thumbnails"><span
class="header-section-number">8.6.5</span> Purging the thumbnails</h3>
<p>Every time you open a folder containing pictures or videos,
thumbnails are created to represent these graphic files. These
thumbnails are stored in a specific folder to reuse them, rather than
being forced to recompute them every time you access this kind of
files.<br />
The problem raises when you delete a graphic file, because its thumbnail
is kept in the system, and this leads to a certain amount of disk space
wasted to store obsolete thumbnails.<br />
To purge them, it is enough to remove their corresponding folder:</p>
<pre><code>rm -Rf ~/.cache/thumbnails</code></pre>
<p>This folder will be created again, the next time the system needs to
store a newly generated thumbnail.</p>

<p>Debian GNU/Linux uses the package repository system to better manage

<strong>deb</strong> is the short for “debian”, the mother company. To
distribute its software, Debian uses a specific archive file format:
“.deb”. It is a compressed format, like the “.zip” that you use to save
your data. These “.deb” archives are recognized by the different Debian
package managers (APT and its graphical interface Synaptic) and thus can
be handled more easily.</p>

<p><strong>Apt</strong> is the main package manager on Debian: it is
used when upgrading, installing or removing packages from the Debian

It can also install a local package with one advantage:
<strong>apt</strong> manages dependencies (other packages needed for the

and must be used in administrative mode.</p>
<p><strong>To install an external package:</strong></p>
<pre><code>dpkg -i package_name.deb</code></pre>

<h2 data-number="8.8" id="installing-flatpak-applications"><span
class="header-section-number">8.8</span> Installing Flatpak
applications</h2>
<p><img src="img/apps/flatpak.png#left" /><br />
<strong>Flatpak</strong> (<a
href="https://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/getting-started.html">https://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/getting-started.html</a>)
is a virtualization application system for GNU/Linux distributions. The
objective is to provide a safe “sandbox” environment, isolated from the
rest of the system, where users can run applications not validated by
the distribution repositories (test versions, for example). <em>dixit
Wikipedia</em></p>
<p><img src="img/misc/noob-info.png#left" /><br />
<strong>… I virtualize in the sandbox …?</strong><br />
The applications that you download from the Debian repositories are
“.deb” formated archives containing the application itself. These
applications use common dependencies, are linked to each other, and have
access to your entire system. Debian repositories are secure, so no
worries about this issue. But then why should we use Flatpak?<br />
The Flatpak format works differently: the application is compressed with
all its dependencies, making it completely independent of the system on
which it is installed. So, here you can install and use a freshly
updated application or even a brand new one, compared to the Debian
repositories.<br />
The second advantage of this format is the famous “sandbox”. The
<em>sandbox</em> is a kind of secure box in which the application runs,
without having access to the rest of the system (with exceptions, when
the user gives its authorization), thereby preventing malicious software
from going through your application to contaminate your system.<br />
The last advantage is that it enables you to run multiple versions of
the same application (very practical for Minetest and servers in
different versions).<br />
The downside of this format is that it is not verified by the Debian
security: when installing <em>flatpaks</em>, you should prefer trusted
referenced applications (Gimp, VLC, Blender …).</p>
<h3 data-number="8.8.1" id="installing-flatpak"><span
class="header-section-number">8.8.1</span> Installing Flatpak</h3>
<p>To take advantage of applications in Flatpak format, you must first
install the corresponding package. From your terminal in administrator
mode (<a href="#administrator-mode-example">chap.3.8.3</a>):</p>
<pre><code>apt install flatpak</code></pre>
<p>You can now download and install <em>flatpak</em> packages by
visiting one of the websites grouping these applications like Flathub
(<a href="https://flathub.org/home">https://flathub.org/home</a>). But
the simplest way consists to add a repository to your sources in order
to take advantage of the full applications lists without having to
search through the site.</p>
<h3 data-number="8.8.2" id="add-a-flatpak-repository"><span

<pre><code>flatpak remote-add flathub https://dl.flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo</code></pre>
<p>You will be asked for the administrator password. And you will have

<p>First of all, one must know that <strong>several Debian distribution
branches</strong> exist in parallel.</p>
<p>Namely the <strong>oldstable</strong>, <strong>stable</strong>,
<strong>testing</strong> and <strong>unstable</strong> distributions, as
well as an <strong>experimental</strong> branch.</p>
<p>The <strong>Stable distribution</strong> is the Debian official
distribution, the one released at this moment, which is maintained and
updated by the Debian teams. The only changes made to it concern the
security updates and the bug fixes. It is recommended to favor this
version.</p>
<p>The <strong>Oldstable distribution</strong> is the previous stable
version. It is usually supported by the Debian teams during one year
after the release of the new stable version. However it might live
longer if enough individuals or companies continue to assure its
maintenance. Then it is called a LTS (standing for Long Term Support)
distribution: we extend its life span.</p>
<p>The <strong>Testing distribution</strong> is the future Stable
version. It is used to prepared the next stable version. When everything
is OK, when all the bit and pieces are functioning well together, when
all the features targeted by the Debian teams are included, and after a
period of software freeze and bug hunting, then the Testing version
becomes the official new Stable distribution.</p>
<p>The <strong>Unstable distribution</strong>, <em>nicknamed Sid</em>,
is the version which receives all the new packages versions, and sits at
the cutting edge of innovation, but is not very stable: it’s a research
lab. Nevertheless some brave adventurers use it on a daily basis.</p>
<p>The <strong>Experimental distribution</strong> is not a Debian
distribution <em>per se</em>, but rather a repository where alpha or
beta software versions are tested.</p>
<p>All these distributions are given a nickname picked among the
characters of the Toy Story® cartoon. Currently, the name of the
<strong>stable version is Bookworm</strong>, the name of the
<strong>testing version is Trixie</strong>, the name of the
<strong>oldstable version is Bullseye</strong>, the Experimental as no
nickname.</p>

<p>The first version of Debian with a nickname was the Debian-1.1
“Buzz”, released as of June 17th, 1996. (<em>see</em> <a

Back up your data</h1>
<p>No matter where your expertize level is, or what is the current state
of your hardware, nobody is immune to a bad cockpit error, a technical
failure, a heavy thunderstorm, a cup of tea/coffee spilled on the
keyboard, or the cat messing around with the central unit …</p>
<p>The hard disk drive capacities are increasing every day and we are
tempted to store on them more and more data (family pictures, videos,
private copies of movies, etc). The risk of losing a large amount of
data also increases at the same time, and that’s why we advise you to
execute regular backups of your personal data, as well as your passwords
and email messages.</p>
<p>This section will endeavor to provide you with simple keys to avoid
the lost of your favorite files during a hardware or software
failure.</p>
<p><img src="img/misc/noob-info.png#left" /><br />
The “cloud” is fashionable these days. Several on-line services are at
your disposal to save your data on an external server…<br />
First of all, you are not immune to a server failure, and secondly, you
have no real control on what your data are going to be used for. The
“cloud” is actually the computer of someone else, as Bibi (a friendly
Debian user) told us recently.</p>
<p>I strongly advise you, in case of doubts (not all services are
subsidiaries of the NSA …) to backup your data locally, that is on your
own physical medium which you fully control.</p>
<h2 data-number="9.1" id="choosing-the-medium"><span
class="header-section-number">9.1</span> Choosing the medium</h2>
<p><img src="img/apps/backup.png#left" /><br />
Backups used to be made on floppy disks, then on CDs and then on DVDs.
Even if you can still use this kind of support, the technology now gives
you access to much larger capacities at little cost.</p>
<p>Depending on the amount of the data to backup, you can find external
disk from 1GB (USB key type) to 2TB (2000GB), being powered directly
over the USB cable, or by an external power supply. The prices range
roughly from 5 to 200 US$, depending on their storage type (HDD,SSD) or
capacity.</p>
<p>Of course, if the size of your data is below 700MB, you can still use
a CD-RW (re-writable CD-Rom) for your backups.</p>
<h2 data-number="9.2" id="graphical-mode-applications"><span
class="header-section-number">9.2</span> Graphical mode

<p><img src="img/apps/archive.png#left" /><br />
Debian hosts in its repositories several utilities (<a
href="https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-reference/ch10.html#_copy_and_synchronization_tools">https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-reference/ch10.html#_copy_and_synchronization_tools</a>)
in the “copy and synchronization” section, each of them offers a
graphical interface or “client”. Here we present one of the simplest
backup tool: Deja-Dup.</p>
<p><strong>Deja-Dup</strong> is more than enough to backup your personal
data, but if you want to execute a “full system backup” (including your
application and the whole installation) you must use more complex
software, as described in the Debian documentation (<a
href="https://wiki.debian.org/BackupAndRecovery">https://wiki.debian.org/BackupAndRecovery</a>).</p>
<h3 data-number="9.2.1" id="backing-up-with-deja-dup"><span

<p><img src="img/apps/deja-dup.png#left" /><br />
<strong>Deja-Dup</strong> (<a
href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/DejaDup">https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/DejaDup</a>)
is a “simplified backup tool”, which is a graphical interface to the
<strong>Duplicity</strong> software (<a
href="https://duplicity.gitlab.io/">https://duplicity.gitlab.io/</a>).
It allows building secured backups of your data within a local folder,
an external disk, a local network, a remote network or somewhere in the
“cloud”.</p>
<p>It also allows the <strong>complete encryption</strong> and
<strong>password protection</strong> of your backup files.</p>
<p><strong>Deja-Dup</strong> offers a <strong>clear interface</strong>
which does not require any computer knowledge.</p>
<h4 data-number="9.2.1.1" id="installing-deja-dup"><span
class="header-section-number">9.2.1.1</span> Installing Deja-Dup</h4>
<p>Deja-Dup can be found in the Debian repositories. To install it using
a terminal in administrator mode (<a
href="#administrator-mode-example">chap.3.8.3</a>):</p>
<pre><code>apt update &amp;&amp; apt install deja-dup</code></pre>
<p>Or using the graphical interfaces (<a
href="#synaptic-the-comprehensive-package-manager">chap.8.5</a>), look
for “deja-dup”.</p>

alt="Deja-Dup: default interface" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Deja-Dup: default interface</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>Deja-Dup</strong> will be accessible from the application
menu &gt; “Utilities” &gt; “Backups”.</p>
<p>On first launch, Deja-Dup’s preferences allow you to select which
folders to back up, which to ignore, as well as the location and
schedule for the backup.</p>
<p>Its simple and intuitive interface will guide you through the
process. Start with “Create my first backup” and add folders to back
up:</p>

alt="Deja-Dup: selecting the folders to save" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Deja-Dup: selecting the folders to
save</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Once the <em>included</em> and <em>excluded</em> folders are defines,
you need to define the backup location. You can select:</p>
<ul>
<li>a USB disk (don’t forget to plug in it first)</li>
<li>a local directory (but in that case, your data won’t be safe if the
disk crashes)</li>
<li>a server of the “cloud” type</li>
</ul>

alt="Deja-Dup: selecting the storage location" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Deja-Dup: selecting the storage

<p>Once the backup location has been configured, Deja-Dup offers you to
secure your data with a password. You will be asked for it during the
restoration.</p>

<img src="img/09-backup/04-dejadup-password.jpg"
alt="Deja-Dup: optional password" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Deja-Dup: optional password</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Then the backup is done directly from the déjà-Dup interface.<br />
The first backup will be shorter or longer depending on the size of the
data to be backed up, subsequent backups will be faster because they
will only take into account the modified files/folders: this is the
incremental backup.</p>

<p>To <strong>restore a backup</strong> on a newly installed system, for
example, simply install <strong>Deja-Dup</strong> on it, launch it and
select “Restore” in the main window.</p>
<p>A series of simple windows will help you find and then recover your
data. As with backup, restore is intuitive: you can navigate through
your backups just like in a file browser.<br />
A drop-down menu at the bottom right allows you to choose the date of
the data you want to restore. Once your data has been selected, click on
“Restore”:</p>

<p><img src="img/apps/archive.png#left" /><br />
If you want to save just one folder or few of them, you can simply use
the file system manager, or your archive manager (to reduce the storage
space through compression).</p>
<p>The latter produces “real” archives: for subsequent consultation of
these data, you need to decompress the archive.<br />
From the file manager, select the folders to be saved, then right-click
and take the “Compress…” (or “Archive”) action.</p>
<p>Then you just have to move the archive file on an external
medium.</p>
<h2 data-number="9.4" id="cloning-the-system"><span
class="header-section-number">9.4</span> Cloning the system</h2>
<p><img src="img/logo/clonezilla.png" /><br />
This is the complete solution ensuring a total safety for your data:
cloning the entire hard disk.</p>
<p><strong>Clonezilla Live</strong> (<a
href="https://clonezilla.org/">https://clonezilla.org/</a>) is a Live CD
based on the Debian GNU/Linux distribution, which includes the
<strong>Clonezilla</strong> software. It allows the user to directly
execute from its machine:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A Backup</strong>: copy the entire disk copy , or one or
several partitions, under the form of an image and save it on any kind
of storage.</li>
<li><strong>A Restore</strong>: restore an image from its storage
location (to the same disk, another disk, another machine, a USB key, a
network, etc.).</li>
<li><strong>A Copy</strong>: direct copy from an original disk to
another destination disk.</li>
</ul>
<p>This Clonezilla version is able to connect to different servers: SSH
server, Samba server, NFS server …</p>
<p>As its name suggests it, it works like a Live CD (CD-ROM, DVD-ROM)
but can also be executed from a USB key, an external disk, etc. (source
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clonezilla">Wikipedia</a>).</p>

Protect your data and your privacy</h1>
<p>The news are crystal clear: Internet is being wire-tapped. It is not
to alarm or frighten you, but you must realize that the “Internet” is
not your private living room, and that each picture or text used on the
web is potentially recoverable.</p>
<h2 data-number="10.1" id="protect-your-system"><span
class="header-section-number">10.1</span> Protect your system</h2>
<h3 data-number="10.1.1" id="physical-security"><span
class="header-section-number">10.1.1</span> Physical security</h3>
<p>This is obvious, but let’s say it once and for all: if you want to
protect your data, <strong>don’t leave your laptop everywhere! Don’t
leave your computer wide open and in self-service at your
home!</strong></p>
<p>Your computer hosts your passwords (bank, administration, work …),
your documents (administrative forms, pictures, etc.), your browsing
history (the sites you visited and when), etc. You may think that these
information are seemingly harmless, but they allow - for the best - to
define your consumer profile, or - for the worst - to use your computer
as a gateway to crack in other persons systems.</p>
<p>If you want to present the distribution you are using, or simply
share your resources, we strongly suggest you create another user
account (<a href="#adding-a-new-user">chap.7.3</a>) that will not be
able to access your data, nor to mess with your system
administration.</p>
<p><img src="img/misc/noob-info.png#left" /><br />
If your computer is always on the road, we suggest you use the
<strong>direct encryption</strong> during the system installation like
mentioned in the <a href="#encryption-whats-for">chapter 5.5.3</a>. By
this way, even if your computer is lost or stolen, it will be extremely
difficult to extract the data residing on your hard disk.</p>
<h3 data-number="10.1.2" id="updates"><span
class="header-section-number">10.1.2</span> Updates</h3>
<p>The software <strong>updates</strong> bring new functionalities, fix
bugs and, above all, <strong>correct potential security
flaws</strong>.</p>
<p>This is the big strength of the Libre-Software: <strong>the program
sources are available</strong>, thus when a flaw is uncovered, it is
publicized and fixed immediately.</p>
<p>This practice to be opposed to the proprietary systems, whose flaws
are being kept secret, and continue to affect the daily life of all
their users.</p>
<p>The <strong>security updates</strong> should not be considered as
optional ones: you must install them as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 data-number="10.1.3" id="passwords"><span
class="header-section-number">10.1.3</span> Passwords</h3>
<p>Each year, tens of thousands of email accounts, Wi-fi access codes,
phone PIN … are easily cracked, because users picked passwords too easy
to guess. The top worst password for the year 2013 was
“<strong>123456</strong>”, but there are other crazy sequences like
“<strong>QWERTYUIOP</strong>”, “<strong>0000</strong>”, animal names,
birthdays …</p>
<p><img src="img/smile/cancel.png" /> <strong>All these passwords, far
too easy to guess, must be avoided !</strong> <img
src="img/smile/cancel.png" /></p>
<p>And, by the way, putting together two weak passwords, does not create
a strong one ! “Independance1783” might be difficult to guess for a
human being, but a “computer robot” will decipher it in the blink of an
eye.</p>
<p>To <strong>increase the robustness of your password</strong>, in
other words to increase its resistance against deciphering attacks, use
as many characters as possible and mix their types (lowercase and
uppercase letters, numbers, special characters).</p>
<p>There are simple tools which allow you to keep and organize your
passwords like KeePassX (<a
href="https://www.keepassx.org/">https://www.keepassx.org/</a>).</p>
<p><img src="img/misc/noob-info.png#left" /><br />
<strong>The stronger my password is, the more difficult it is to
memorize it. Isn’t it ?</strong><br />
You can use a <strong>“pass-phrase</strong>. Here we are talking about a
long sentence, difficult to uncover, but easy to remember: few words put
together produce a meaningless string, but which has a well defined
sense for yourself.<br />
For example, the sentence “grandma loves French pickles in her soup”,
can easily becomes a robust password:
“GrandmaLovesFrenchPicklesInHerSoup” … especially if one replaces few
vowels by numbers (“i” by “1”, “e” by “3” and o by “0”):<br />
“<strong>GrandmaL0v3sFr3nchP1ckl3sInH3rS0up</strong>”.<br />
Note that it works with grandpa too <img

<h2 data-number="10.2" id="protect-your-data"><span

<p><em>It goes without saying … but it’s better by saying it
…</em><br />
External media containing your bakups hould not be left self-service at
home: Make sure to reserve a hard drive for your saved personal data,
and keep it out of sight (and fingers).</p>
<p>You certainly ran into these warning messages talking about backing
up your data …<br />
and this is not for nothing! Please refer to the <a
href="#back-up-your-data">chapter 9</a> and get into <strong>the habit
of saving your data on an external medium and on a regular
basis.</strong></p>

<p><img src="img/misc/noob-info.png#left" /><br />
For the time being, updates are the only efficient protections against
potential viruses, and adding an antivirus software on your system does
not improve its security. Viruses embedded within documents originating
from proprietary systems do not target the GNU/Linux environments, and
as such, are totally harmless for your data.</p>
<p>However, if you want to monitor and control your data,
<strong>ClamAv</strong> is the reference antivirus software. Note that
it does not run continuously in the background, and the user should
explicitly request a <em>folder scan</em> to verify its contents.</p>

<p>Yes, one can find everything on Internet: the best and the worst, and
often inappropriate images and contents for our children. In order to
let them enjoy safely the digital world, you can use different parental

<p><strong>BlockSite</strong> is an extension, which automatically

<p>It is difficult to remain completely anonymous on Internet. Unless
you are a well equipped experienced user, you will always leave a trail
behind you.</p>
<p>The most beautiful fingerprint you leave, on a daily basis, is your
IP address. In fact, each device connected to Internet must have an IP
address, which allows to know not only your ISP, but also your precise
geographical location … A small test? visit this page to know your
public IP address: <a
href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/">https://whatismyipaddress.com/</a></p>
<p>In addition, even if you are not a great pastry chef, you are giving
away a lot of “cookies” to all the sites you are visiting. Cookies are
connection witnesses: they keep, for a given site, information like your
preferences, your identifier, your password, your chosen language, the
content of your digital shopping cart, etc. not only on your computer
but also on the servers in the cloud. Thus, when you start a search
request on a site, it is very capable to register this information.</p>

<h3 data-number="10.5.1" id="social-networks"><span
class="header-section-number">10.5.1</span> Social networks</h3>
<p>Remember that the social networks, in their vast majority, are not
there to help you, quite the contrary: they are big advertising agencies
which collect everything they find about you. Then, these personal
information are resold to advertisers, in order for them to better
target your “needs”.<br />
Intelligence on the social networks does not stop there: they continue
to trace you on plenty of sites by using - for example - the “like” or
“G+” buttons.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the latest scandals unveil the fact that personal data
can be collected by several governmental intelligence agencies, even if
you are not doing anything suspicious.</p>
<p><img src="img/misc/noob-info.png#left" /><br />
If you cannot resist to the temptation of opening an account on a social
network (and I fully understand you: virtual encounters are very cool),
you can try the <strong>Diaspora</strong> or the
<strong>Mastodon</strong> journey and discover a decentralized network,
which is <strong>respectful of your private life and data</strong>;
Diaspora and Mastodon are designed on the “node network principle”,
which means that several connecting points are available. Here is one to
start with: <a
href="https://joindiaspora.com/">https://joindiaspora.com/</a> and <a
href="https://mastodon.social/about">https://mastodon.social/about</a>.</p>
<p>As far as the other “less social” networks are concerned, find
hereafter few simple advises:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use a pseudo instead of your name and forename.</li>
<li>Limit your network to the persons you know in the real life.</li>
<li>Modify your privacy settings in order to be seen by your “friends”
only.</li>
<li>Don’t enter any personal information: address, phone number …</li>
<li>Avoid uploading pictures of yourself or your relatives, let alone
tagging them (with the name of the persons on the photo).</li>
<li>Protect the <em>future</em> privacy of your children…</li>
</ul>
<h2 data-number="10.6" id="private-navigation-within-your-browser"><span
class="header-section-number">10.6</span> Private navigation within your
browser</h2>
<p>If you want to surf the Web without leaving traces on your computer,
the latest versions of the Internet navigators include a
“<strong>private browsing</strong>” feature. This mode functions very
simply: once launched, the navigator does not keep the history of the
visited sites, nor the cookies distributed by these sites, nor the
passwords entered during this “private” session.<br />
However, the visited sites keep track of your IP address: you don’t
navigate in an “anonymous” way.</p>
<p>For Firefox, click on the menu (3-dash button at the top right) then
select the “New Private Window” option.</p>
<figure>

<h2 data-number="10.7" id="private-navigation-on-internet"><span
class="header-section-number">10.7</span> Private navigation on
Internet</h2>
<p><strong>Warning: private does not mean anonymous!</strong></p>
<p>First avoid using non-free navigators, whose source codes cannot be
analyzed by the first expert that comes along. The non-free navigators
(Edge, Safari, Chrome …) can potentially spy on your navigation without
your knowledge.</p>
<p>The main free navigator you can trust is Firefox.</p>
<p><strong>The private navigation</strong> allows the removal of all
navigation traces on your computer and can add few more protections
against the tracking. It cannot guarantee your anonymity when facing
some advanced tracking technology like the fingerprinting (<a
href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Canvas_fingerprinting">https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Canvas_fingerprinting</a>).
But Firefox, in its latest releases, can block the digital fingerprint
trackers. Go to the top right “burger” menu &gt; Preferences &gt;
Privacy &amp; Security tab. For more information : <a
href="https://blog.mozilla.org/firefox/how-to-block-fingerprinting-with-firefox/">https://blog.mozilla.org/firefox/how-to-block-fingerprinting-with-firefox/</a></p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Firefox: privacy &amp;

</figure>
<p>The two following Firefox extensions, can also make more difficult
the tracking of your internet navigation, by modifying you navigator
“profile” on a regular basis:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chameleon <a
href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/chameleon-ext/">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/chameleon-ext/</a></li>
<li>CanvasBlocker <a
href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/canvasblocker/">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/canvasblocker/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The “NoScript Security Suite” extension blocks the “tracking” scripts
by automatically disabling some specific scripts. But you must realize
that this can generate a lot of problems with numerous internet pages.
To be reserved for the most seasoned! <a

<p>Stop doing like everyone else, even if supposedly “you have nothing

<ul>
<li><strong>Do not make all your search requests on Google or
Bing</strong> … even if they function very well, you might not want
these companies to keep for tens of year your web search on “solution

<p>If you want to become anonymous and mask completely your IP address,
the best idea is to use <strong>TOR</strong> (<a
href="https://www.torproject.org/index.html">https://www.torproject.org/index.html</a>).
To achieve this, we are going to describe two methods: installation of
the <strong>Tor-Browser</strong>, and the usage of the
<strong>Tails</strong> <em>anonymous distribution</em>.</p>
<p><img src="img/misc/noob-info.png#left" /><br />
<strong>… What’s this <em>Tor</em> stuff ??</strong><br />
<strong>TOR</strong> stands for <strong>T</strong>he
<strong>O</strong>nion <strong>R</strong>outer, and is a software
allowing us to become anonymous on the net by communicating with other
TOR users. The principle is to define a random and indirect route on the
network, between you and the exit node, which makes impossible the
tracking of your IP address.<br />
In addition, the data circulating on the TOR network are encrypted,
which makes even more difficult to identify the flows, although they are
spied on.</p>
<p>This functionality must not prevent you to keep some common sense …
If you connect to an account, whatever it might be, with your usual
pseudo and password, you will be quickly identified, even if you use
TOR.</p>
<h3 data-number="10.8.1" id="tor-browser-an-anonymous-navigator"><span
class="header-section-number">10.8.1</span> Tor-Browser, an anonymous
navigator</h3>
<p><strong>Debian</strong> offers the <strong>TorBrowser</strong> in its
repository. The Tor navigator is not <em>physically</em> present in this
Debian repository, but it is rather a launcher which will fetch its
latest version on the official site and verify the package signature as
well.<br />
The <strong>torbrowser-launcher</strong> is available in the
<strong>contrib</strong> section of the Debian repositories. To add this
section, use the <a href="#modifying-the-repositories">chapter 8.1.4</a>
method and modify your sources.list to get this result:</p>
<pre><code>deb http://deb.debian.org/debian/ bookworm main contrib non-free-firmware</code></pre>
<p>Once repositories modified, within a terminal in admin mode:</p>
<pre><code>apt update
apt install torbrowser-launcher</code></pre>
<p>Once this is done, we can initiate the TorBrowser download via the
<strong>tor-browser-launcher</strong> (here on Gnome-Shell):</p>

<p>Note that Tor proposes its browser as a stand-alone archive (no need
for backports repositories nor administrative password). You can
download the archive from the official website: <a
href="https://www.torproject.org/download/">https://www.torproject.org/download/</a>.<br />
Decompress the downloaded archive, then navigate in the tree structure
to the ./browser/start-tor-browser file; click on it :). You must leave
this directory in place, and “manually” launch the Tor navigator, or
drag-and-drop the “tor-browser.desktop” either on the desktop or within
the task bar.</p>

<p><strong>Tails</strong> is a GNU/Linux distribution based on Debian.
It allows you to be <strong>totally anonymous</strong> on the net. It is
installed on a DVD or a USB key, and likewise using other Debian Live
(autonomous) images, nothing is saved on your DVD or USB key between two
working sessions, and, in addition, you enjoy an anonymous navigation on
Internet.</p>
<p>On the <a href="https://tails.boum.org/index.en.html">main
website</a>, you can read …</p>
<p>Tails is a live (autonomous) operating system that you can start on
almost any computer from a DVD, USB stick, or SD card. It aims at
preserving your privacy and anonymity, and helps you to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>use the Internet anonymously</strong> and <strong>circumvent
censorship</strong>; all connections to the Internet are forced to go
through the Tor network;</li>
<li><strong>leave no trace</strong> on the computer you are using unless
you ask it explicitly;</li>
<li><strong>use state-of-the-art cryptographic tools</strong> to encrypt
your files, emails and instant messaging.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information, you can visit the Tails download page <a
href="https://tails.boum.org/install/download/index.en.html">https://tails.boum.org/install/download/index.en.html</a>.</p>
<p><img src="img/misc/noob-info.png#left" /><br />
Note that the TOR navigation is often slowed down, and that some sites
or functionalities will not be reachable, due to their embedded scripts
or their “privacy” policies …<br />
Is it the right time to sort out through all your bookmarks ? <img

<p>No! You must be aware that internet browsing works thanks to a
<strong>physical network of connected machines</strong>. A person with
physical access to the different “connection points” will be able to
observe the traffic and capture informations immediately, or to store
this information for a further consultation.<br />
In addition, computer monitoring is not the only way to identify you and
your navigation: video surveillance of public or private places,
labeling of machines “<em>for your safety</em>” are only examples of all
the possibilities of the authorities and companies to access your
valuable data.<br />
It is up to everyone to define his “private life” and not spread it on
the web … Or to move on to more political than technical considerations
for the Privacy Protection <img src="img/smile/wink.png" />.</p>

Foundation</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.fsf.org/">https://www.fsf.org/</a><br />
The Free Software Foundation (FSF) is a non-profit organization with a
worldwide mission to promote computer user freedom. We defend the rights
of all software users.<br />
Free software developers guarantee everyone equal rights to their
programs; any user can study the source code, modify it, and share the
program. By contrast, most software carries fine print that denies users
these basic rights, leaving them susceptible to the whims of its owners
and vulnerable to surveillance.</p>
<h3 data-number="12.1.2" id="the-gnu-project"><span
class="header-section-number">12.1.2</span> The GNU project</h3>
<p><img src="img/12-annuaire/logo_gnu.png" /><br />
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/">https://www.gnu.org/</a><br />
Philosophy of the GNU Project: Free software means that the software’s
users have freedom. (The issue is not about price.) We developed the GNU
operating system so that users can have freedom in their computing
experience.<br />
Specifically, free software means users have the four essential
freedoms: (0) to run the program, (1) to study and change the program
source code, (2) to redistribute exact copies, and (3) to distribute
modified versions.<br />
Software differs from material objects — such as chairs, sandwiches, and
gasoline — in that it can be copied and changed much more easily. These
facilities are why software is useful; we believe a program’s user
should be free to take advantage of them, not solely its developer.</p>

The Linux Foundation partners with the world’s leading developers and
companies to solve the hardest technology problems and to accelerate
open technology development and commercial adoption.<br />
Founded in 2000, The Linux Foundation today provides tools, training,
and events to scale any open source project, which by teaming all
together delivers an economic impact not achievable by any other
company.</p>

<p><img src="img/12-annuaire/logo_playit.png" /><br />
This site is dedicated to one goal: to twist the neck to the most
persistent rumor about GNU/Linux.<br />
Of course I alm talking about: “Your linusque there, it sucks, there is
no game which can run on it!”.</p>
<p><strong>./play.it</strong> is a libre software that automates the
build of native packages for multiple distributions from DRM-free
installers for commercial games. The generated packages are then
installed using the standard tools provided by the distribution.<br />
Native Linux games are supported, as well as games developed for other
systems, thanks to tools like WINE, DOSBox and ScummVM.<br />
More detailed descriptions, including installation and usage
instructions, are available in the documentation of the main
distributions we support: Debian, Gentoo, Ubuntu (in French only).<br />
Other distributions like Arch Linux are supported, as well as
derivatives of these distributions like Manjaro or Linux Mint.</p>
<p>If your games are anything that still keeps you from getting rid of
your dual-boot with Windows, the end of the tunnel is not that far
away!<br />

Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales has distinguished Wikinews from
Wikipedia by saying “on Wikinews, each story is to be written as a news
story as opposed to an encyclopedia article.” The neutral point of view
policy espoused in Wikinews distinguishes it from other citizen
journalism efforts. In contrast to most projects of the Wikimedia
Foundation, Wikinews allows original work under the form of original
reporting and interviews.</p>

Meta (or Wikimedia’s Meta-Wiki) is a wiki-based web site that is
auxiliary for coordination of all the Wikimedia Foundation
projects.<br />
Meta currently serves as one of the major avenues of discussion for
Wikimedians including Wikipedians, the others being the mailing lists,
the IRC channels, and the talk pages of individual articles and users.
Meta is an independent and autonomous project from the English language
Wikipedia and thus has its own policies and customs, which often differ
from those here.<br />
Originally focused on the English language version of Wikipedia, Meta
has, since its upgrade to Wikipedia’s custom MediaWiki software, become
a multilingual discussion forum used by all Wikimedia language
communities.</p>

project (Wikipedia, Wiktionary, Wikibooks, Wikinews, Wikiquote and
Wikivoyage) that does not yet have its own sub-domain, provided that it
is a recognized language.<br />

btrfs … and handles a multitude of file systems from other
architectures, including FAT , VFAT (ie FAT32), NTFS (DOS/Windows file
systems), ISO 9660, etc.<br />
A file system is called “journalized” when it keeps a record (log) of
the operations being performed, and then saves them on the disk.<br />
These types of file systems (for example ext3/4 or Reiserfs and also
NTFS) are more tolerant to system crashes because they keep the system
consistent (no need anymore to use <em>fsck</em> or <em>scandisk</em> at
start-up).</p>

permanent memory (hard disk).</p>
<h3 data-number="13.12.3" id="free-software"><span
class="header-section-number">13.12.3</span> Free Software</h3>
<p>“Free Software” is a concept of free applications and operating
systems, whose source codes are left open by the developers, in order
for everybody to inspect and improve them. One example is the GNU/Linux
initiative which regroups free and gratis operating systems like Debian,
but also the LibreOffice suite, the free alternative to Microsoft™
Office, or Firefox and Chromium the free alternatives to Microsoft™
Edge.</p>
<h3 data-number="13.12.4" id="long-its-not-gonna-be"><span

<h3 data-number="13.13.1" id="mail"><span
class="header-section-number">13.13.1</span> Mail</h3>
<p>mail refers to a letter sent by Internet via email software
(e.g. Icedove). The mails are free, usually limited to 10MB, which can
be accompanied by attachments (images, documents …) and sent to
recipient(s) (At :) and potentially people in copy (CC :). Unwanted
mails are called junk or spam.</p>
<h3 data-number="13.13.2" id="memory-card"><span
class="header-section-number">13.13.2</span> Memory card</h3>
<p>A memory card is a small device able to permanently store digital
data, likewise a USB key. The memory card is intended to be plugged into
digital cameras or camcorders. It can store photos and movies, and can
be read back by computer featuring a memory card slot. Among the most
popular formats, we find the MemoryStick card for Sony devices, and SD
for most others. A recent memory card can store thousands of photos.</p>
<h3 data-number="13.13.3" id="motherboard"><span
class="header-section-number">13.13.3</span> Motherboard</h3>
<p>The motherboard is the main component of the CPU. Its role is to
centralize and process all the data exchanged between the processor and
the peripherals. The motherboard therefore manages the hard disk, the
CD/DVD drive, the keyboard, the mouse, the network, the various USB
ports …</p>
<h2 data-number="13.14" id="n"><span
class="header-section-number">13.14</span> N</h2>
<h3 data-number="13.14.1" id="no-life"><span
class="header-section-number">13.14.1</span> No Life</h3>
<p>Nolife is an insane geek or nerd so passionate by his computer
activity that he/she spends all his time with his/her passion neglecting
everything else and in consequence has no (or very few) social life. No
comment …</p>
<h3 data-number="13.14.2" id="noob"><span
class="header-section-number">13.14.2</span> Noob</h3>
<p>The “Noob” term (derived from “newbie” or novice) refers to a
computer novice. It is not necessarily a pejorative term.</p>
<h3 data-number="13.14.3" id="notification-area"><span
class="header-section-number">13.14.3</span> Notification Area</h3>
<p>The notification area is usually located at the right of the taskbar.
You can usually find in there, the time, the network indicator, the
sound volume. This is where the messages appear when the system has
something to tell you (e.g. the battery is running empty, updates are
available …)</p>
<h2 data-number="13.15" id="o"><span
class="header-section-number">13.15</span> O</h2>
<h3 data-number="13.15.1" id="operating-system"><span
class="header-section-number">13.15.1</span> Operating System</h3>
<p>This is the set of software that manages the computer hardware and
provides common services for the application programs. By extension, it
is also viewed as the main interface with the end users.<br />
Some examples of operating systems : GNU/Linux, Windows, Mac OS X,
FreeBSD.</p>
<h3 data-number="13.15.2" id="os"><span
class="header-section-number">13.15.2</span> OS</h3>

<h3 data-number="13.16.1" id="package-manager"><span
class="header-section-number">13.16.1</span> Package Manager</h3>
<p>A package manager is the software which installs, updates and
uninstalls the system packages. On Debian, Synaptic is the graphical
front-end of the APT Debian package manager.</p>
<h3 data-number="13.16.2" id="partition"><span
class="header-section-number">13.16.2</span> Partition</h3>
<p>To use certain media such as hard disks, we need to structure them,
to break them down into rather large subsets: partitions. In turn, each
partition is then structured as a separate file system. Splitting a hard
drive into multiple partitions allows, for example, the coexistence, on
the same disk, of two different operating systems like GNU/Linux and
Windows, which use different file systems.</p>
<h3 data-number="13.16.3" id="phishing"><span
class="header-section-number">13.16.3</span> Phishing</h3>
<p>Phishing is a scam practice which tricks an user by sending him an
email with a forged sender address and including a link to a fake
website mimicking its bank site, or an e-commerce site, and asking him
to update its information … If the user get trapped (or phished) then
his sensitive information (private data, bank account details, …) can be
used to evil ends.</p>
<h3 data-number="13.16.4" id="pixel"><span
class="header-section-number">13.16.4</span> Pixel</h3>
<p>a Pixel is the smallest controllable element of a picture represented
on the screen. A pixel can display one color at a time. Thus the screen
is composed with million of these pixels, spread in both directions
(height and width), and they come together to form the screen image. A
pixel is so small that you can barely see it with the naked eye. The
more pixels compose an image and the sharper it is.</p>
<h3 data-number="13.16.5" id="plugin"><span
class="header-section-number">13.16.5</span> Plugin</h3>
<p>A plugin is a software component that adds a specific feature to an
existing computer program. Allowing for example a web browser to read
more image, video, animation or sound formats. Sometimes also called
“add-on”.</p>
<h3 data-number="13.16.6" id="ps2-port"><span
class="header-section-number">13.16.6</span> PS/2 Port</h3>
<p>PS/2 port represents a couple of plugs located in the rear of the
system unit. The purple plug connects the keyboard, while the green one
connects the mouse.<br />
Having said that, we should mention that the PS/2 port is not used very
often these days and replaced by the universal USB ports. One of the big
disadvantage of this port is that it is not a hot-plug : a device
connected after the computer startup won’t be recognized.</p>
<h3 data-number="13.16.7" id="processor"><span
class="header-section-number">13.16.7</span> Processor</h3>
<p>The processor, also named Central Processing Unit (CPU), is the
electronic circuitry within a computer that carries out the instructions
of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetic, logical,
control and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the
instructions.<br />
In particular, it handles the data exchanges between the various
components of the system (hard drive, memory, mouse, graphics card …)
and performs all the computation needed to interact with the you through
the data displayed on the screen.<br />
There is also the Graphics Processor Unit (GPU) which is a special
component of the graphics card which accelerates the creation of images
in a frame buffer intended for output to a display.</p>
<h2 data-number="13.17" id="q"><span
class="header-section-number">13.17</span> Q</h2>
<h3 data-number="13.17.1" id="queue"><span
class="header-section-number">13.17.1</span> Queue</h3>

to be printed are put first in the printer spool queue.</p>
<h3 data-number="13.17.2" id="quit-to"><span
class="header-section-number">13.17.2</span> Quit (to)</h3>
<p>Terminate the execution of a program. Example : give me a pay raise
or a quit my job.</p>
<h2 data-number="13.18" id="r"><span
class="header-section-number">13.18</span> R</h2>
<h3 data-number="13.18.1" id="ram"><span
class="header-section-number">13.18.1</span> RAM</h3>
<p>RAM stands for Random-Access Memory. It is the computer volatile data
storage. Its major advantage is the speed at which one can read from or
write to it, as opposed to other direct access data storage media where
the time required to read and write data items varies, depending on
their locations and/or some mechanical limitations such as the media
rotation speeds and arm movement delays.</p>
<h3 data-number="13.18.2" id="right-click-1"><span
class="header-section-number">13.18.2</span> Right-click</h3>
<p>A right-click is the action of pressing and releasing (almost)
immediately the mouse right button. A right-click will display a
contextual menu corresponding to the pointed element. In particular, it
allows to copy, move, delete and rename the pointed element when it is a
file or a folder.</p>
<h3 data-number="13.18.3" id="rtfm"><span
class="header-section-number">13.18.3</span> RTFM</h3>
<p>Means “Read The Fucking Manual”. This is an abbreviation that is
thrown wildly at the head of someone asking a question, to encourage him
to do first his home work in reading the documentation.<br />
This is because people sometimes ask trivial questions, whose answers
are readily available in the man pages or on the Internet, and often
these people are not used to the power of the documentation in the Unix
world.</p>

engine will then return the most relevant results.</p>
<h3 data-number="13.19.2" id="shortcut"><span
class="header-section-number">13.19.2</span> Shortcut</h3>
<p>A shortcut is an icon placed anywhere and providing a quick access to
a software or a location on your computer. Most of the time a shortcut
is used to launch a program. Deleting a shortcut does not uninstall the
program it is associated with, and does not delete either the linked
file.</p>

class="header-section-number">13.20.1</span> Tab/Tabulation</h3>
<p>Generally present in modern Internet browsers, tabs allow to browse
multiple sites simultaneously. To switch from one site to another, you
just have to click on its corresponding tab. Tabs are represented like
tabs in a workbook.</p>
<h3 data-number="13.20.2" id="terminal"><span
class="header-section-number">13.20.2</span> Terminal</h3>
<p>We call a terminal, the command line console which is available and
essential in all GNU/Linux distributions.<br />
Even though many GUIs are available for virtually any application,
nothing is more efficient, for example, than updating your entire system
by typing one single command line.</p>
<p>Note : a terminal is a very useful tool to debug a program.</p>
<h3 data-number="13.20.3" id="troll"><span
class="header-section-number">13.20.3</span> Troll</h3>
<p>In the world of Usenet, forums of all kinds, mailing lists, IRC, and
all these places open to online discussions, a troll is a person who
sows discord by starting arguments or upsetting people, by posting
inflammatory, extraneous, or off-topic messages with the intent of
provoking readers into an emotional response. By extension the subject
of the argument itself.<br />
Known examples : “GNU/Linux or Windows”, “Women in Free Software”.</p>
<h2 data-number="13.21" id="u"><span

class="header-section-number">13.21.1</span> Unit (Central)</h3>
<p>For a desktop, the central unit is the box containing all the
electronic equipment that allows the computer to operate. The Keyboard,
mouse, monitor, speakers etc. are all connected to it. The hard disk
drive is located in this central unit, for example.<br />
For a laptop, there is no Central Unit. All the electronic components
are grouped under the Keyboard.</p>
<h3 data-number="13.21.2" id="unix"><span
class="header-section-number">13.21.2</span> Unix</h3>
<p>Unix is a multitasking, multi-user computer OS. The original Unix
system was developed in 1969. Several versions were created later on,
and today, GNU/Linux is taking its inspiration from this family and
continues with the same philosophy.<br />
Unix systems are characterized by a modular design that is sometimes
called the “Unix philosophy,” meaning that the OS provides a set of
tools, each of which performing a well-defined function, and an unified
file system to perform complex work-flows.</p>
<p>The main Unixes (or Unices) are : the BSD family (NetBSD, FreeBSD,
OpenBSD), AIX, Solaris, HP-UX, Mac Os X.</p>
<h3 data-number="13.21.3" id="update"><span
class="header-section-number">13.21.3</span> Update</h3>

class="header-section-number">13.21.4</span> URL</h3>
<p>The URL (Uniform Ressource Locator) points to the address of a
website like “https://www.debian.org”. By typing an URL in the browser
address bar, you go directly to the desired site, without having to go
through a search engine. You never need to type the %%“https://www.”%%
address header, simply enter “debian.org”.</p>
<h3 data-number="13.21.5" id="usb"><span
class="header-section-number">13.21.5</span> USB</h3>
<p>USB stands for Universal Serial Bus. It is the cable with a
rectangular connector that wants to be universal: almost all current
hardware devices are connected to your computer via USB. Computers now
have USB ports on the back, on the front of the Central Unit, and even
sometimes on your monitor.</p>
<p>It usually requires 3 steps to plug an USB connector: try to plug it
in a first try, it does not work. Turn over the connector and retry, it
does not work too. Retry with the initial position and the connector
will fit in. This is as mysterious as the sock which disappears in the
washer…</p>

introduced with the IBM PS/2 in 1987. The term can also mean either an
analog computer display standard, the 15-pin D-subminiature VGA
connector or the 640x480 resolution itself. While this resolution was
superseded in the personal computer market in the 1990s, mobile devices
have only caught up in the last few years.</p>

<p>A window is a rectangular area that appears on the screen to display,
for example, the contents of a folder, or a text file, or some software
output. The window can take all the space (full-screen) or only a part
of the screen real estate. It is possible to view multiple windows
simultaneously and drag items from one to another using the drag and
drop technique.</p>
<h3 data-number="13.23.5" id="window-manager"><span
class="header-section-number">13.23.5</span> Window Manager</h3>
<p>The window manager is the X (graphical) client software that controls
the placement and appearance of windows (title bar, framing, moving,
resizing, etc..) within a windowing system in a graphical user
interface. Most window managers are designed to help provide a desktop
environment.<br />
Applications, handle the inside of the window they created and manage
their content and the interaction with the user.<br />
It is possible to change the window manager and see all the look and
feel of the screen change completely.<br />
When the window manager can do many other things in addition to what has
