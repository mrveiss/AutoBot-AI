  name: vim
  options:
  - '-c: {command} {command} will be executed after the first file has been read.
    {command} is interpreted as an Ex command. If the {command} contains spaces it
    must be enclosed in double quotes (this depends on the shell that is used). Example:
    vim "+set si" main.c Note: You can use up to 10 "+" or "-c" commands.'
  - '-A: If Vim has been compiled with ARABIC support for editing right-to-left oriented
    files and Arabic keyboard mapping, this option starts Vim in Arabic mode, i.e.
    ''arabic'' is set. Otherwise an error message is given and Vim aborts.'
  - '-b: Binary mode. A few options will be set that makes it possible to edit a binary
    or executable file.'
  - '-C: Compatible. Set the ''compatible'' option. This will make Vim behave mostly
    like Vi, even though a .vimrc file exists.'
  - '-d: Start in diff mode. There should between two to eight file name arguments.
    Vim will open all the files and show differences between them. Works like vimdiff(1).'
  - '-d: {device}, -dev {device} Open {device} for use as a terminal. Only on the
    Amiga. Example: "-d con:20/30/600/150".'
  - '-D: Debugging. Go to debugging mode when executing the first command from a script.'
  - '-e: Start Vim in Ex mode, just like the executable was called "ex".'
  - '-E: Start Vim in improved Ex mode, just like the executable was called "exim".'
  - '-f: Foreground. For the GUI version, Vim will not fork and detach from the shell
    it was started in. On the Amiga, Vim is not restarted to open a new window. This
    option should be used when Vim is executed by a program that will wait for the
    edit session to finish (e.g. mail). On the Amiga the ":sh" and ":!" commands will
    not work.'
  - '-F: If Vim has been compiled with FKMAP support for editing right-to-left oriented
    files and Farsi keyboard mapping, this option starts Vim in Farsi mode, i.e. ''fkmap''
    and ''rightleft'' are set. Otherwise an error message is given and Vim aborts.
    Note: Farsi support has been removed in patch 8.1.0932.'
  - '-g: If Vim has been compiled with GUI support, this option enables the GUI. If
    no GUI support was compiled in, an error message is given and Vim aborts.'
  - '-H: If Vim has been compiled with RIGHTLEFT support for editing right-to-left
    oriented files and Hebrew keyboard mapping, this option starts Vim in Hebrew mode,
    i.e. ''hkmap'' and ''rightleft'' are set. Otherwise an error message is given
    and Vim aborts.'
  - "-i: {viminfo} Specifies the filename to use when reading or writing the viminfo\
    \ file, instead of the default \"~/.viminfo\". This can also be used to skip the\
    \ use of the .viminfo file, by giv\u2010 ing the name \"NONE\"."
  - '-l: Lisp mode. Sets the ''lisp'' and ''showmatch'' options on.'
  - '-L: Same as -r.'
  - '-m: Modifying files is disabled. Resets the ''write'' option. You can still modify
    the buffer, but writing a file is not possible.'
  - '-M: Modifications not allowed. The ''modifiable'' and ''write'' options will
    be unset, so that changes are not allowed and files can not be written. Note that
    these options can be set to enable making modifications.'
  - '-n: No swap file will be used. Recovery after a crash will be impossible. Handy
    if you want to edit a file on a very slow medium (e.g. floppy). Can also be done
    with ":set uc=0". Can be undone with ":set uc=200".'
  - '-N: No-compatible mode. Resets the ''compatible'' option. This will make Vim
    behave a bit better, but less Vi compatible, even though a .vimrc file does not
    exist.'
  - '-nb: Become an editor server for NetBeans. See the docs for details.'
  - '-P: {parent-title} Win32 GUI only: Specify the title of the parent application.
    When possible, Vim will run in an MDI window inside the application. {parent-title}
    must appear in the window title of the parent application. Make sure that it is
    specific enough. Note that the implementation is still primitive. It won''t work
    with all applications and the menu doesn''t work.'
  - '-r: List swap files, with information about using them for recovery.'
  - '-r: {file} Recovery mode. The swap file is used to recover a crashed editing
    session. The swap file is a file with the same filename as the text file with
    ".swp" appended. See ":help recovery".'
  - '-R: Read-only mode. The ''readonly'' option will be set. You can still edit the
    buffer, but will be prevented from accidentally overwriting a file. If you do
    want to overwrite a file, add an exclamation mark to the Ex command, as in ":w!".
    The -R option also implies the -n option (see above). The ''readonly'' option
    can be reset with ":set noro". See ":help ''readonly''".'
  - '-s: Silent mode. Only when started as "Ex" or when the "-e" option was given
    before the "-s" option.'
  - '-s: {scriptin} The script file {scriptin} is read. The characters in the file
    are interpreted as if you had typed them. The same can be done with the command
    ":source! {scriptin}". If the end of the file is reached before the editor exits,
    further characters are read from the keyboard.'
  - '-S: {file} {file} will be sourced after the first file has been read. This is
    equivalent to -c "source {file}". {file} cannot start with ''-''. If {file} is
    omitted "Session.vim" is used (only works when -S is the last argument).'
  - '-T: {terminal} Tells Vim the name of the terminal you are using. Only required
    when the automatic way doesn''t work. Should be a terminal known to Vim (builtin)
    or defined in the termcap or terminfo file.'
  - '-u: {vimrc} Use the commands in the file {vimrc} for initializations. All the
    other initializations are skipped. Use this to edit a special kind of files. It
    can also be used to skip all initializations by giving the name "NONE". See ":help
    initialization" within vim for more details.'
  - '-U: {gvimrc} Use the commands in the file {gvimrc} for GUI initializations. All
    the other GUI initializations are skipped. It can also be used to skip all GUI
    initializations by giving the name "NONE". See ":help gui-init" within vim for
    more details.'
  - '-v: Start Vim in Vi mode, just like the executable was called "vi". This only
    has effect when the executable is called "ex".'
  - '-w: {scriptout} All the characters that you type are recorded in the file {scriptout},
    until you exit Vim. This is useful if you want to create a script file to be used
    with "vim -s" or ":source!". If the {scriptout} file exists, characters are appended.'
  - '-W: {scriptout} Like -w, but an existing file is overwritten.'
  - '-x: If Vim has been compiled with encryption support, use encryption when writing
    files. Will prompt for a crypt key.'
  - '-X: Don''t connect to the X server. Shortens startup time in a terminal, but
    the window title and clipboard will not be used.'
  - '-y: Start Vim in easy mode, just like the executable was called "evim" or "eview".
    Makes Vim behave like a click-and-type editor.'
  - '-Z: Restricted mode. Works like the executable starts with "r".'
  - '--clean: Do not use any personal configuration (vimrc, plugins, etc.). Useful
    to see if a problem reproduces with a clean Vim setup.'
  - '--cmd: {command} Like using "-c", but the command is executed just before processing
    any vimrc file. You can use up to 10 of these commands, independently from "-c"
    commands.'
  - '--echo-wid: GTK GUI only: Echo the Window ID on stdout.'
  - '--gui-dialog-file: {name} When using the GUI, instead of showing a dialog, write
    the title and message of the dialog to file {name}. The file is created or appended
    to. Only useful for testing, to avoid that the test gets stuck on a dialog that
    can''t be seen. Without the GUI the argument is ignored.'
  - '--literal: Take file name arguments literally, do not expand wildcards. This
    has no effect on Unix where the shell expands wildcards.'
  - '--log: {filename} If Vim has been compiled with eval and channel feature, start
    logging and write entries to {filename}. This works like calling ch_logfile({filename},
    ''ao'') very early during startup.'
  - '--nofork: Foreground. For the GUI version, Vim will not fork and detach from
    the shell it was started in.'
  - '--noplugin: Skip loading plugins. Implied by -u NONE.'
  - '--not-a-term: Tells Vim that the user knows that the input and/or output is not
    connected to a terminal. This will avoid the warning and the two second delay
    that would happen.'
  - '--remote: Connect to a Vim server and make it edit the files given in the rest
    of the arguments. If no server is found a warning is given and the files are edited
    in the current Vim.'
  - '--remote-expr: {expr} Connect to a Vim server, evaluate {expr} in it and print
    the result on stdout.'
  - '--remote-send: {keys} Connect to a Vim server and send {keys} to it.'
  - '--remote-silent: As --remote, but without the warning when no server is found.'
  - '--remote-wait: As --remote, but Vim does not exit until the files have been edited.'
  - '--remote-wait-silent: As --remote-wait, but without the warning when no server
    is found.'
  - '--serverlist: List the names of all Vim servers that can be found.'
  - '--servername: {name} Use {name} as the server name. Used for the current Vim,
    unless used with a --remote argument, then it''s the name of the server to connect
    to.'
  - '--socketid: {id} GTK GUI only: Use the GtkPlug mechanism to run gVim in another
    window.'
  - '--startuptime: {file} During startup write timing messages to the file {fname}.'
  - '--ttyfail: When stdin or stdout is not a a terminal (tty) then exit right away.'
  - '--version: Print version information and exit.'
  - '--windowid: {id} Win32 GUI only: Make gVim try to use the window {id} as a parent,
    so that it runs inside that window. ON-LINE HELP Type ":help" in Vim to get started.
    Type ":help subject" to get help on a specific subject. For example: ":help ZZ"
    to get help for the "ZZ" command. Use <Tab> and CTRL-D to complete subjects (":help
    cmdline-completion"). Tags are present to jump from one place to another (sort
    of hypertext links, see ":help"). All documentation files can be viewed in this
    way, for example ":help syntax.txt". FILES /usr/local/share/vim/vim??/doc/*.txt
