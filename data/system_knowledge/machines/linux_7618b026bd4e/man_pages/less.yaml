  name: less
  options:
  - '-a: or --search-skip-screen By default, forward searches start at the top of
    the displayed screen and backwards searches start at the bottom of the displayed
    screen (except for repeated searches invoked by the n or N commands, which start
    after or before the "target" line respectively; see the -j option for more about
    the target line). The -a option causes forward searches to instead start at the
    bottom of the screen and backward searches to start at the top of the screen,
    thus skipping all lines displayed on the screen.'
  - '-A: or --SEARCH-SKIP-SCREEN Causes all forward searches (not just non-repeated
    searches) to start just after the target line, and all backward searches to start
    just before the target line. Thus, forward searches will skip part of the displayed
    screen (from the first line up to and including the target line). Similarly backwards
    searches will skip the displayed screen from the last line up to and including
    the target line. This was the default behavior in less versions prior to 441.'
  - '-bn: or --buffers=n Specifies the amount of buffer space less will use for each
    file, in units of kilobytes (1024 bytes). By default 64 KB of buffer space is
    used for each file (unless the file is a pipe; see the -B option). The -b option
    specifies instead that n kilobytes of buffer space should be used for each file.
    If n is -1, buffer space is unlimited; that is, the entire file can be read into
    memory.'
  - "-B: or --auto-buffers By default, when data is read from a pipe, buffers are\
    \ allocated automatically as needed. If a large amount of data is read from the\
    \ pipe, this can cause a large amount of memory to be allocated. The -B option\
    \ disables this automatic allocation of buffers for pipes, so that only 64 KB\
    \ (or the amount of space specified by the -b option) is used for the pipe. Warning:\
    \ use of -B can result in erroneous display, since only the most recently viewed\
    \ part of the piped data is kept in memory; any earlier data is lost. Lost characters\
    \ are dis\u2010 played as question marks."
  - '-c: or --clear-screen Causes full screen repaints to be painted from the top
    line down. By default, full screen repaints are done by scrolling from the bottom
    of the screen.'
  - '-C: or --CLEAR-SCREEN Same as -c, for compatibility with older versions of less.'
  - '-d: or --dumb The -d option suppresses the error message normally displayed if
    the terminal is dumb; that is, lacks some important capability, such as the ability
    to clear the screen or scroll backward. The -d option does not otherwise change
    the behavior of less on a dumb terminal.'
  - "-Dxcolor: or --color=xcolor Changes the color of different parts of the displayed\
    \ text. x is a single character which selects the type of text whose color is\
    \ being set: B Binary characters. C Control characters. E Errors and informational\
    \ messages. H Header lines and columns, set via the --header option. M Mark letters\
    \ in the status column. N Line numbers enabled via the -N option. P Prompts. R\
    \ The rscroll character. S Search results. W The highlight enabled via the -w\
    \ option. 1-5 The text in a search result which matches the first through fifth\
    \ parenthesized sub-pattern. Sub-pattern coloring works only if less is built\
    \ with one of the regular expres\u2010 sion libraries posix, pcre, or pcre2. d\
    \ Bold text. k Blinking text. s Standout text. u Underlined text. The uppercase\
    \ letters and digits can be used only when the --use-color option is enabled.\
    \ When text color is specified by both an uppercase letter and a lowercase letter,\
    \ the upper\u2010 case letter takes precedence. For example, error messages are\
    \ normally displayed as standout text. So if both \"s\" and \"E\" are given a\
    \ color, the \"E\" color applies to error mes\u2010 sages, and the \"s\" color\
    \ applies to other standout text. The lowercase letters refer to bold and underline\
    \ text formed by overstriking with backspaces (see the -U option) and to non-content\
    \ text (such as line numbers and prompts), but not to text formatted using ANSI\
    \ escape sequences with the -R option (but see the note below for different behavior\
    \ on Win\u2010 dows and MS-DOS). A lowercase letter may be followed by a + to\
    \ indicate that the normal format change and the specified color should both be\
    \ used. For example, -Dug displays underlined text as green without underlining;\
    \ the green color has replaced the usual underline formatting. But -Du+g displays\
    \ underlined text as both green and in underlined format. color is either a 4-bit\
    \ color string or an 8-bit color string: A 4-bit color string is one or two characters,\
    \ where the first character specifies the foreground color and the second specifies\
    \ the background color as follows: b Blue c Cyan g Green k Black m Magenta r Red\
    \ w White y Yellow The corresponding uppercase letter denotes a brighter shade\
    \ of the color. For example, -DNGk displays line numbers as bright green text\
    \ on a black background, and -DEbR displays er\u2010 ror messages as blue text\
    \ on a bright red background. If either character is a \"-\" or is omitted, the\
    \ corresponding color is set to that of normal text. An 8-bit color string is\
    \ one or two decimal integers separated by a dot, where the first integer specifies\
    \ the foreground color and the second specifies the background color. Each integer\
    \ is a value between 0 and 255 inclusive which selects a \"CSI 38;5\" color value\
    \ (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#SGR). If either integer\
    \ is a \"-\" or is omitted, the corresponding color is set to that of normal text.\
    \ A 4-bit or 8-bit color string may be followed by one or more of the following\
    \ characters to set text attributes in addition to the color. s or ~ Standout\
    \ (reverse video) u or _ Underline d or * Bold l or & Blinking On MS-DOS and Windows,\
    \ the --color option behaves differently from what is described above in these\
    \ ways: \u2022 The bold (d and *) and blinking (l and &) text attributes at the\
    \ end of a color string are not supported. \u2022 Lowercase color selector letters\
    \ refer to text formatted by ANSI escape sequences with -R, in addition to overstruck\
    \ and non-content text (but see -Da). \u2022 For historical reasons, when a lowercase\
    \ color selector letter is followed by a numeric color value, the number is not\
    \ interpreted as an \"CSI 38;5\" color value as described above, but instead as\
    \ a 4-bit CHAR_INFO.Attributes value, between 0 and 15 inclusive (see https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/console/char-info-str).\
    \ To avoid confusion, it is recommended that the equivalent letters rather than\
    \ numbers be used after a lowercase color selector on MS-DOS/Windows. \u2022 Numeric\
    \ color values (\"CSI 38;5\" color) following an uppercase color selector letter\
    \ are not supported on systems earlier than Windows 10. \u2022 Only a limited\
    \ set of ANSI escape sequences to set color in the content work correctly. 4-bit\
    \ color sequences work, but \"CSI 38;5\" color sequences do not. \u2022 The -Da\
    \ option makes the behavior of --color more similar to its behavior on non-MS-DOS/Windows\
    \ systems by (1) making lowercase color selector letters not affect text format\u2010\
    \ ted with ANSI escape sequences, and (2) allowing \"CSI 38;5\" color sequences\
    \ in the content work by passing them to the terminal (only on Windows 10 and\
    \ later; on earlier Win\u2010 dows systems, such sequences do not work regardless\
    \ of the setting of -Da)."
  - '-e: or --quit-at-eof Causes less to automatically exit the second time it reaches
    end-of-file. By default, the only way to exit less is via the "q" command.'
  - '-E: or --QUIT-AT-EOF Causes less to automatically exit the first time it reaches
    end-of-file.'
  - '-f: or --force Forces non-regular files to be opened. (A non-regular file is
    a directory or a device special file.) Also suppresses the warning message when
    a binary file is opened. By default, less will refuse to open non-regular files.
    Note that some operating systems will not allow directories to be read, even if
    -f is set.'
  - '-F: or --quit-if-one-screen Causes less to automatically exit if the entire file
    can be displayed on the first screen.'
  - '-g: or --hilite-search Normally, less will highlight ALL strings which match
    the last search command. The -g option changes this behavior to highlight only
    the particular string which was found by the last search command. This can cause
    less to run somewhat faster than the default.'
  - '-G: or --HILITE-SEARCH The -G option suppresses all highlighting of strings found
    by search commands.'
  - '-hn: or --max-back-scroll=n Specifies a maximum number of lines to scroll backward.
    If it is necessary to scroll backward more than n lines, the screen is repainted
    in a forward direction instead. (If the terminal does not have the ability to
    scroll backward, -h0 is implied.)'
  - '-i: or --ignore-case Causes searches to ignore case; that is, uppercase and lowercase
    are considered identical. This option is ignored if any uppercase letters appear
    in the search pattern; in other words, if a pattern contains uppercase letters,
    then that search does not ignore case.'
  - '-I: or --IGNORE-CASE Like -i, but searches ignore case even if the pattern contains
    uppercase letters.'
  - "-jn: or --jump-target=n Specifies a line on the screen where the \"target\" line\
    \ is to be positioned. The target line is the line specified by any command to\
    \ search for a pattern, jump to a line number, jump to a file percentage or jump\
    \ to a tag. The screen line may be specified by a number: the top line on the\
    \ screen is 1, the next is 2, and so on. The number may be negative to speci\u2010\
    \ fy a line relative to the bottom of the screen: the bottom line on the screen\
    \ is -1, the second to the bottom is -2, and so on. Alternately, the screen line\
    \ may be specified as a fraction of the height of the screen, starting with a\
    \ decimal point: .5 is in the middle of the screen, .3 is three tenths down from\
    \ the first line, and so on. If the line is speci\u2010 fied as a fraction, the\
    \ actual line number is recalculated if the terminal window is resized. If the\
    \ --header option is used and the target line specified by -j would be obscured\
    \ by the header, the target line is moved to the first line after the header.\
    \ While the --header option is active, the -S option is ignored, and lines longer\
    \ than the screen width are truncated. If any form of the -j option is used, repeated\
    \ forward searches (invoked with \"n\" or \"N\") begin at the line immediately\
    \ after the target line, and repeated backward searches begin at the target line,\
    \ unless changed by -a or -A. For example, if \"-j4\" is used, the target line\
    \ is the fourth line on the screen, so forward searches begin at the fifth line\
    \ on the screen. However nonrepeated searches (invoked with \"/\" or \"?\") always\
    \ begin at the start or end of the current screen respectively."
  - '-J: or --status-column Displays a status column at the left edge of the screen.
    The character displayed in the status column may be one of: > The line is chopped
    with the -S option, and the text that is chopped off beyond the right edge of
    the screen contains a match for the current search. < The line is horizontally
    shifted, and the text that is shifted beyond the left side of the screen contains
    a match for the current search. = The line is both chopped and shifted, and there
    are matches beyond both sides of the screen. * There are matches in the visible
    part of the line but none to the right or left of it. a-z, A-Z The line has been
    marked with the corresponding letter via the m command.'
  - '-kfilename: or --lesskey-file=filename Causes less to open and interpret the
    named file as a lesskey(1) binary file. Multiple -k options may be specified.
    If the LESSKEY or LESSKEY_SYSTEM environment variable is set, or if a lesskey
    file is found in a standard place (see KEY BINDINGS), it is also used as a lesskey
    file. Note the warning under "--lesskey-content" below.'
  - "-K: or --quit-on-intr Causes less to exit immediately (with status 2) when an\
    \ interrupt character (usually ^C) is typed. Normally, an interrupt character\
    \ causes less to stop whatever it is doing and re\u2010 turn to its command prompt.\
    \ Note that use of this option makes it impossible to return to the command prompt\
    \ from the \"F\" command."
  - '-L: or --no-lessopen Ignore the LESSOPEN environment variable (see the INPUT
    PREPROCESSOR section below). This option can be set from within less, but it will
    apply only to files opened subsequently, not to the file which is currently open.'
  - '-m: or --long-prompt Causes less to prompt verbosely (like more(1)), with the
    percent into the file. By default, less prompts with a colon.'
  - '-M: or --LONG-PROMPT Causes less to prompt even more verbosely than more(1).'
  - "-n: or --line-numbers Suppresses line numbers. The default (to use line numbers)\
    \ may cause less to run more slowly in some cases, especially with a very large\
    \ input file. Suppressing line numbers with the -n option will avoid this problem.\
    \ Using line numbers means: the line number will be displayed in the verbose prompt\
    \ and in the = command, and the v command will pass the cur\u2010 rent line number\
    \ to the editor (see also the discussion of LESSEDIT in PROMPTS below)."
  - '-N: or --LINE-NUMBERS Causes a line number to be displayed at the beginning of
    each line in the display.'
  - '-ofilename: or --log-file=filename Causes less to copy its input to the named
    file as it is being viewed. This applies only when the input file is a pipe, not
    an ordinary file. If the file already exists, less will ask for confirmation before
    overwriting it.'
  - '-Ofilename: or --LOG-FILE=filename The -O option is like -o, but it will overwrite
    an existing file without asking for confirmation. If no log file has been specified,
    the -o and -O options can be used from within less to specify a log file. Without
    a file name, they will simply report the name of the log file. The "s" command
    is equivalent to specifying -o from within less.'
  - '-ppattern: or --pattern=pattern The -p option on the command line is equivalent
    to specifying +/pattern; that is, it tells less to start at the first occurrence
    of pattern in the file.'
  - '-Pprompt: or --prompt=prompt Provides a way to tailor the three prompt styles
    to your own preference. This option would normally be put in the LESS environment
    variable, rather than being typed in with each less command. Such an option must
    either be the last option in the LESS variable, or be terminated by a dollar sign.'
  - '-Ps: followed by a string changes the default (short) prompt to that string.'
  - '-Pm: changes the medium (-m) prompt.'
  - '-PM: changes the long (-M) prompt.'
  - '-Ph: changes the prompt for the help screen.'
  - '-Pw: changes the message printed while waiting for data (in the "F" command).
    All prompt strings consist of a sequence of letters and special escape sequences.
    See the section on PROMPTS for more details.'
  - '-q: or --quiet or --silent Causes moderately "quiet" operation: the terminal
    bell is not rung if an attempt is made to scroll past the end of the file or before
    the beginning of the file. If the terminal has a "visual bell", it is used instead.
    The bell will be rung on certain other errors, such as typing an invalid character.
    The default is to ring the terminal bell in all such cases.'
  - '-Q: or --QUIET or --SILENT Causes totally "quiet" operation: the terminal bell
    is never rung. If the terminal has a "visual bell", it is used in all cases where
    the terminal bell would have been rung.'
  - '-r: or --raw-control-chars Causes "raw" control characters to be displayed. The
    default is to display control characters using the caret notation; for example,
    a control-A (octal 001) is displayed as "^A" (with some exceptions as described
    under the -U option). Warning: when the -r option is used, less cannot keep track
    of the actual appearance of the screen (since this depends on how the screen responds
    to each type of control character). Thus, various display problems may result,
    such as long lines being split in the wrong place. USE OF THE -r OPTION IS NOT
    RECOMMENDED.'
  - "-R: or --RAW-CONTROL-CHARS Like -r, but only ANSI \"color\" escape sequences\
    \ and OSC 8 hyperlink sequences are output in \"raw\" form. Unlike -r, the screen\
    \ appearance is maintained correctly, provided that there are no escape sequences\
    \ in the file other than these types of escape sequences. Color escape sequences\
    \ are only supported when the color is changed within one line, not across lines.\
    \ In other words, the beginning of each line is assumed to be normal (non-colored),\
    \ regardless of any escape sequences in previous lines. For the purpose of keeping\
    \ track of screen appearance, these escape sequences are assumed to not move the\
    \ cursor. OSC 8 hyperlinks are sequences of the form: ESC ] 8 ; ... \\7 The terminating\
    \ sequence may be either a BEL character (\\7) or the two-character sequence \"\
    ESC \\\". ANSI color escape sequences are sequences of the form: ESC [ ... m where\
    \ the \"...\" is zero or more color specification characters. You can make less\
    \ think that characters other than \"m\" can end ANSI color escape sequences by\
    \ setting the environment variable LESSANSIENDCHARS to the list of characters\
    \ which can end a color escape sequence. And you can make less think that characters\
    \ other than the standard ones may appear be\u2010 tween the ESC and the m by\
    \ setting the environment variable LESSANSIMIDCHARS to the list of characters\
    \ which can appear."
  - '-s: or --squeeze-blank-lines Causes consecutive blank lines to be squeezed into
    a single blank line. This is useful when viewing nroff output.'
  - '-S: or --chop-long-lines Causes lines longer than the screen width to be chopped
    (truncated) rather than wrapped. That is, the portion of a long line that does
    not fit in the screen width is not displayed until you press RIGHT-ARROW. The
    default is to wrap long lines; that is, display the remainder on the next line.
    See also the --wordwrap option.'
  - '-ttag: or --tag=tag The -t option, followed immediately by a TAG, will edit the
    file containing that tag. For this to work, tag information must be available;
    for example, there may be a file in the current directory called "tags", which
    was previously built by ctags(1) or an equivalent command. If the environment
    variable LESSGLOBALTAGS is set, it is taken to be the name of a command compatible
    with global(1), and that command is executed to find the tag. (See http://www.gnu.org/software/global/global.html).
    The -t option may also be specified from within less (using the - command) as
    a way of examining a new file. The command ":t" is equivalent to specifying -t
    from within less.'
  - '-Ttagsfile: or --tag-file=tagsfile Specifies a tags file to be used instead of
    "tags".'
  - '-u: or --underline-special Causes backspaces and carriage returns to be treated
    as printable characters; that is, they are sent to the terminal when they appear
    in the input.'
  - '-U: or --UNDERLINE-SPECIAL Causes backspaces, tabs, carriage returns and "formatting
    characters" (as defined by Unicode) to be treated as control characters; that
    is, they are handled as specified by the -r option. By default, if neither -u
    nor -U is given, backspaces which appear adjacent to an underscore character are
    treated specially: the underlined text is displayed using the terminal''s hardware
    underlining capability. Also, backspaces which appear between two identical characters
    are treated specially: the overstruck text is printed using the terminal''s hardware
    boldface capability. Other backspaces are deleted, along with the preceding character.
    Carriage returns immediately followed by a newline are deleted. Other carriage
    returns are handled as specified by the -r option. Unicode formatting characters,
    such as the Byte Order Mark, are sent to the terminal. Text which is overstruck
    or underlined can be searched for if neither -u nor -U is in effect. See also
    the --proc-backspace, --proc-tab, and --proc-return options.'
  - '-V: or --version Displays the version number of less.'
  - '-w: or --hilite-unread Temporarily highlights the first "new" line after a forward
    movement of a full page. The first "new" line is the line immediately following
    the line previously at the bottom of the screen. Also highlights the target line
    after a g or p command. The highlight is removed at the next command which causes
    movement. If the --status-line option is in effect, the entire line (the width
    of the screen) is highlighted. Otherwise, only the text in the line is highlighted,
    unless the -J option is in effect, in which case only the status column is highlighted.'
  - '-W: or --HILITE-UNREAD Like -w, but temporarily highlights the first new line
    after any forward movement command larger than one line.'
  - '-X: or --no-init Disables sending the termcap initialization and deinitialization
    strings to the terminal. This is sometimes desirable if the deinitialization string
    does something unnecessary, like clearing the screen.'
  - '-yn: or --max-forw-scroll=n Specifies a maximum number of lines to scroll forward.
    If it is necessary to scroll forward more than n lines, the screen is repainted
    instead. The -c or -C option may be used to repaint from the top of the screen
    if desired. By default, any forward movement causes scrolling.'
  - '-zn: or --window=n or -n Changes the default scrolling window size to n lines.
    The default is one screenful. The z and w commands can also be used to change
    the window size. The "z" may be omitted for compatibility with some versions of
    more(1). If the number n is negative, it indicates n lines less than the current
    screen size. For example, if the screen is 24 lines, -z-4 sets the scrolling window
    to 20 lines. If the screen is resized to 40 lines, the scrolling window automatically
    changes to 36 lines.'
  - '--exit-follow-on-close: When using the "F" command on a pipe, less will automatically
    stop waiting for more data when the input side of the pipe is closed.'
  - "--file-size: If --file-size is specified, less will determine the size of the\
    \ file immediately after opening the file. Then the \"=\" command will display\
    \ the number of lines in the file. Normal\u2010 ly this is not done, because it\
    \ can be slow if the input file is non-seekable (such as a pipe) and is large."
  - '--follow-name: Normally, if the input file is renamed while an F command is executing,
    less will continue to display the contents of the original file despite its name
    change. If --follow-name is specified, during an F command less will periodically
    attempt to reopen the file by name. If the reopen succeeds and the file is a different
    file from the original (which means that a new file has been created with the
    same name as the original (now renamed) file), less will display the contents
    of that new file.'
  - '--incsearch: Subsequent search commands will be "incremental"; that is, less
    will advance to the next line containing the search pattern as each character
    of the pattern is typed in.'
  - '--mouse: Enables mouse input: scrolling the mouse wheel down moves forward in
    the file, scrolling the mouse wheel up moves backwards in the file, left-click
    sets the "#" mark to the line where the mouse is clicked, and right-click (or
    any other) returns to the "#" mark position. If a left-click is performed with
    the mouse cursor on an OSC 8 hyperlink, the hyperlink is selected as if by the
    ^O^N command. If a left-click is performed with the mouse cursor on an OSC 8 hyperlink
    which is already selected, the hyperlink is opened as if by the ^O^O command.
    The number of lines to scroll when the wheel is moved can be set by the --wheel-lines
    option. Mouse input works only on terminals which support X11 mouse reporting,
    and on the Windows version of less.'
  - '--MOUSE: Like --mouse, except the direction scrolled on mouse wheel movement
    is reversed.'
  - "--no-keypad: Disables sending the keypad initialization and deinitialization\
    \ strings to the terminal. This is sometimes useful if the keypad strings make\
    \ the numeric keypad behave in an undesir\u2010 able manner."
  - "--no-histdups: This option changes the behavior so that if a search string or\
    \ file name is typed in, and the same string is already in the history list, the\
    \ existing copy is removed from the histo\u2010 ry list before the new one is\
    \ added. Thus, a given string will appear only once in the history list. Normally,\
    \ a string may appear multiple times."
  - '--no-number-headers: Header lines (defined via the --header option) are not assigned
    line numbers. Line number 1 is assigned to the first line after any header lines.'
  - '--no-search-header-lines: Searches do not include header lines, but still include
    header columns.'
  - '--no-search-header-columns: Searches do not include header columns, but still
    include header lines.'
  - '--no-search-headers: Searches do not include header lines or header columns.'
  - '--no-vbell: Disables the terminal''s visual bell.'
  - "--proc-backspace: If set, backspaces are handled as if neither the -u option\
    \ nor the -U option were set. That is, a backspace adjacent to an underscore causes\
    \ text to be displayed in underline mode, and a backspace between identical characters\
    \ cause text to be displayed in boldface mode. This option overrides the -u and\
    \ -U options, so that display of backspaces can be con\u2010 trolled separate\
    \ from tabs and carriage returns. If not set, backspace display is controlled\
    \ by the -u and -U options."
  - '--PROC-BACKSPACE: If set, backspaces are handled as if the -U option were set;
    that is backspaces are treated as control characters.'
  - "--proc-return: If set, carriage returns are handled as if neither the -u option\
    \ nor the -U option were set. That is, a carriage return immediately before a\
    \ newline is deleted. This option over\u2010 rides the -u and -U options, so that\
    \ display of carriage returns can be controlled separate from that of backspaces\
    \ and tabs. If not set, carriage return display is controlled by the -u and -U\
    \ options."
  - '--PROC-RETURN: If set, carriage returns are handled as if the -U option were
    set; that is carriage returns are treated as control characters.'
  - "--proc-tab: If set, tabs are handled as if the -U option were not set. That is,\
    \ tabs are expanded to spaces. This option overrides the -U option, so that display\
    \ of tabs can be controlled sep\u2010 arate from that of backspaces and carriage\
    \ returns. If not set, tab display is controlled by the -U options."
  - '--PROC-TAB: If set, tabs are handled as if the -U option were set; that is tabs
    are treated as control characters.'
  - '--redraw-on-quit: When quitting, after sending the terminal deinitialization
    string, redraws the entire last screen. On terminals whose terminal deinitialization
    string causes the terminal to switch from an alternate screen, this makes the
    last screenful of the current file remain visible after less has quit.'
  - '--save-marks: Save marks in the history file, so marks are retained across different
    invocations of less.'
  - '--show-preproc-errors: If a preprocessor produces data, then exits with a non-zero
    exit code, less will display a warning.'
  - '--status-line: If a line is marked, the entire line (rather than just the status
    column) is highlighted. Also lines highlighted due to the -w option will have
    the entire line highlighted. If'
  - '--use-color: is set, the line is colored rather than highlighted.'
  - '--use-backslash: This option changes the interpretations of options which follow
    this one. After the --use-backslash option, any backslash in an option string
    is removed and the following character is taken literally. This allows a dollar
    sign to be included in option strings.'
  - '--use-color: Enables colored text in various places. The -D option can be used
    to change the colors. Colored text works only if the terminal supports ANSI color
    escape sequences (as defined in https://www.ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-48).'
  - '--wordwrap: When the -S option is not in use, wrap each line at a space or tab
    if possible, so that a word is not split between two lines. The default is to
    wrap at any character.'
  purpose: display the contents of a file in a terminal
