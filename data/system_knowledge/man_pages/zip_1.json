The input archive is scanned as usual, but zip will ignore some problems. The resulting archive should be valid, but any inconsistent entries will be left out. When doubled as in -FF, the archive is scanned from the beginning and zip scans for special signatures to identify the limits between the archive members. The single -F is more reli\u2010 able if the archive is not too much damaged, so try this option first. If the archive is too damaged or the end has been truncated, you must use -FF. This is a change from zip 2.32, where the -F option is able to read a truncated archive. The -F op\u2010 tion now more reliably fixes archives with minor damage and the -FF option is needed to fix archives where -F might have been sufficient before. Neither option will recover archives that have been incorrectly transferred in ascii mode instead of binary. After the repair, the -t option of unzip may show that some files have a bad CRC. Such files cannot be recovered; you can remove them from the archive using the -d option of zip. Note that -FF may have trouble fixing archives that include an embedded zip archive that was stored (without compression) in the archive and, depending on the damage, it may find the entries in the embedded archive rather than the archive itself. Try -F first as it does not have this problem. The format of the fix commands have changed. For example, to fix the damaged archive foo.zip, zip -F foo --out foofix tries to read the entries normally, copying good entries to the new archive foofix.zip. If this doesn't work, as when the archive is truncated, or if some entries you know are in the archive are missed, then try zip -FF foo --out foofixfix and compare the resulting archive to the archive created by -F. The -FF option may create an inconsistent archive. Depending on what is damaged, you can then use the -F option to fix that archive. A split archive with missing split files can be fixed using -F if you have the last split of the archive (the .zip file). If this file is missing, you must use -FF to fix the archive, which will prompt you for the splits you have. Currently the fix options can't recover entries that have a bad checksum or are otherwise damaged."

Normally when an archive is updated, new files are added and changed files are updated but files that no longer ex\u2010 ist on the OS are not deleted from the archive. This option enables a new mode that checks entries in the archive against the file system. If the file time and file size of the en\u2010 try matches that of the OS file, the entry is copied from the old archive instead of being read from the file system and compressed. If the OS file has changed, the entry is read and compressed as usual. If the entry in the archive does not match a file on the OS, the entry is deleted. Enabling this option should create archives that are the same as new archives, but since existing entries are copied instead of compressed, updating an existing archive with -FS can be much faster than creating a new archive. Also consider using -u for updating an archive. For this option to work, the archive should be updated from the same directory it was created in so the relative paths match. If few files are being copied from the old archive, it may be faster to create a new archive instead. Note that the timezone environment variable TZ should be set according to the local timezone in order for this option to work correctly. A change in timezone since the original archive was created could result in no times matching and recompression of all files. This option deletes files from the archive. If you need to preserve the original archive, make a copy of the archive first or use the --out option to output the updated archive to a new file.

(Note for PKZIP users: the equivalent command is pkzip -rP foo *.c PKZIP does not allow recursion in directories other than the current one.) The backslash avoids the shell filename substitution, so that the name matching is performed by zip at all directory levels. [This is for Unix and other systems where \\ escapes the next character. For other systems where the shell does not process * do not use \\ and the above is zip -r foo . -i *.c Examples are for Unix unless otherwise specified.] So to include dir, a directory directly under the current directory, use zip -r foo . -i dir/\\* or zip -r foo . -i \"dir/*\" to match paths such as dir/a and dir/b/file.c [on ports without wildcard expansion in the shell such as MSDOS and Windows zip -r foo . -i dir/* is used.] Note that currently the trailing / is needed for directories (as in zip -r foo . -i dir/ to include directory dir). The long option form of the first example is zip -r foo . --include \\*.c and does the same thing as the short option form. Though the command syntax used to require -i at the end of the command line, this version actually allows -i (or --include) anywhere. The list of files terminates at the next argu\u2010 ment starting with -, the end of the command line, or the list terminator @ (an argument that is just @). So the above can be given as zip -i \\*.c @ -r foo . for example. There must be a space between the option and the first file of a list. For just one file you can use the single value form zip -i\\*.c -r foo . (no space between option and value) or zip --include=\\*.c -r foo . as additional examples. The single value forms are not recommended because they can be confusing and, in particular, the -ifile format can cause problems if the first letter of file combines with i to form a two-letter option starting with i. Use -sc to see how your command line will be parsed. Also possible: zip -r foo . -i@include.lst which will only include the files in the current directory and its subdirectories that match the patterns in the file include.lst.

As the archive is created, if the size of the archive reaches the specified split size, that split is closed and the next split opened. In general all splits but the last will be the split size and the last will be whatever is left. If the entire archive is smaller than the split size a single-file archive is created. Split archives are stored in numbered files. For example, if the output archive is named archive and three splits are required, the resulting archive will be in the three files archive.z01, archive.z02, and archive.zip. Do not change the numbering of these files or the archive will not be readable as these are used to determine the order the splits are read. Split size is a number optionally followed by a multiplier. Currently the number must be an integer. The multiplier can currently be one of k (kilobytes), m (megabytes), g (giga\u2010 bytes), or t (terabytes). As 64k is the minimum split size, numbers without multipliers default to megabytes. For example, to create a split archive called foo with the contents of the bar directory with splits of 670 MB that might be useful for burning on CDs, the command: zip -s 670m -r foo bar could be used. Currently the old splits of a split archive are not excluded from a new archive, but they can be specifically excluded. If possible, keep the input and output archives out of the path being zipped when creating split archives. Using -s without -sp as above creates all the splits where foo is being written, in this case the current directory. This split mode updates the splits as the archive is being cre\u2010 ated, requiring all splits to remain writable, but creates split archives that are readable by any unzip that supports split archives. See -sp below for enabling split pause mode which allows splits to be written directly to removable media. The option -sv can be used to enable verbose splitting and provide details of how the splitting is being done. The -sb option can be used to ring the bell when zip pauses for the next split destination. Split archives cannot be updated, but see the -O (--out) option for how a split archive can be updated as it is copied to a new archive. A split archive can also be converted into a single-file archive using a split size of 0 or negating the -s option: zip -s 0 split.zip --out single.zip Also see -U (--copy) for more on using copy mode."

When an entry is missing the Unicode path, zip reverts back to the standard file path. The problem with using the standard path is this path is in the local character set of the zip that created the entry, which may contain characters that are not valid in the character set being used by the unzip. When zip is reading an archive, if an entry also has a Unicode path, zip now defaults to using the Unicode path to recreate the standard path using the current local character set. This option can be used to determine what zip should do with this path if there is a mismatch between the stored standard path and the stored UTF-8 path (which can happen if the standard path was updated). In all cases, if there is a mismatch it is assumed that the standard path is more current and zip uses that. Values for v are q - quit if paths do not match w - warn, continue with standard path i - ignore, continue with standard path n - no Unicode, do not use Unicode paths The default is to warn and continue. Characters that are not valid in the current character set are escaped as #Uxxxx and #Lxxxxxx, where x is an ASCII character for a hex digit. The first is used if a 16-bit character number is sufficient to represent the Unicode character and the second if the character needs more than 16 bits to represent it's Unicode character code. Setting -UN to e - escape as in zip archive -sU -UN=e forces zip to escape all characters that are not printable 7-bit ASCII. Normally zip stores UTF-8 directly in the standard path field on systems where UTF-8 is the current character set and stores the UTF-8 in the new extra fields otherwise. The option u - UTF-8 as in zip archive dir -r -UN=UTF8 forces zip to store UTF-8 as native in the archive. Note that storing UTF-8 directly is the default on Unix systems that support it. This option could be useful on Windows systems where the escaped path is too large to be a valid path and the UTF-8 version of the path is smaller, but native UTF-8 is not backward compatible on Windows systems."
