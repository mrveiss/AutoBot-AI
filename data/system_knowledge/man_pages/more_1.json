In the following descriptions, ^X means control-X. h or ? Help; display a summary of these commands. If you forget all other commands, remember this one. SPACE Display next k lines of text. Defaults to current screen size. z Display next k lines of text. Defaults to current screen size. Argument becomes new default. RETURN Display next k lines of text. Defaults to 1. Argument becomes new default. d or ^D Scroll k lines. Default is current scroll size, initially 11. Argument becomes new default. q or Q or INTERRUPT Exit. s Skip forward k lines of text. Defaults to 1. f Skip forward k screenfuls of text. Defaults to 1. b or ^B Skip backwards k screenfuls of text. Defaults to 1. Only works with files, not pipes. ' Go to the place where the last search started. = Display current line number. /pattern Search for kth occurrence of regular expression. Defaults to 1. n Search for kth occurrence of last regular expression. Defaults to 1. !command or :!command Execute command in a subshell. v Start up an editor at current line. The editor is taken from the environment variable VISUAL if defined, or EDITOR if VISUAL is not defined, or defaults to vi(1) if neither VISUAL nor EDITOR is defined. ^L Redraw screen. :n Go to kth next file. Defaults to 1. :p Go to kth previous file. Defaults to 1. :f Display current file name and line number. . Repeat previous command. ENVIRONMENT The more command respects the following environment variables, if they exist: MORE This variable may be set with favored options to more. SHELL Current shell in use (normally set by the shell at login time). TERM The terminal type used by more to get the terminal characteristics necessary to manipulate the screen. VISUAL The editor the user prefers. Invoked when command key v is pressed. EDITOR The editor of choice when VISUAL is not specified. POSIXLY_CORRECT Disable exit-on-eof (see option -e for more details). HISTORY The more command appeared in 3.0BSD. This man page documents more version 5.19 (Berkeley 6/29/88), which is currently in use in the Linux community. Documentation was produced using several other versions of the man page, and extensive inspection of the source code. AUTHORS Eric Shienbrood, UC Berkeley. Modified by Geoff Peck, UCB to add underlining, single spacing. Modified by John Foderaro, UCB to add -c and MORE environment variable."
