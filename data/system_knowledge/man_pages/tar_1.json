If tar was invoked with the --compare (--diff, -d) command line option, this means that some files in the archive differ from their disk counterparts. If tar was given one of the --create, --append or --update options, this exit code means that some files were changed while being archived and so the resulting archive does not contain the ex\u2010 act copy of the file set. 2 Fatal error. This means that some fatal, unrecoverable error occurred. If a subprocess that had been invoked by tar exited with a nonzero exit code, tar itself exits with that code as well.
