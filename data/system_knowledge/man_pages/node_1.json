When used and set to a supported value, both the NO_COLOR and NODE_DISABLE_COLORS environment variables are ignored. Any other value will result in colorized output being disabled. NO_COLOR Alias for NODE_DISABLE_COLORS NODE_DEBUG modules... Comma-separated list of core modules that should print debug information. NODE_DEBUG_NATIVE modules... Comma-separated list of C++ core modules that should print debug information. NODE_DISABLE_COLORS When set to 1, colors will not be used in the REPL. NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS file When set, the well-known \u201croot\u201d CAs (like VeriSign) will be extended with the extra certificates in file. The file should consist of one or more trusted certificates in PEM format. If file is missing or misformatted, a message will be emitted once using process.emitWarning(), but any errors are otherwise ignored. This environment variable is ignored when `node` runs as setuid root or has Linux file capabilities set. The NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS environment variable is only read when the Node.js process is first launched. Changing the value at runtime using process.env.NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS has no ef\u2010 fect on the current process. NODE_ICU_DATA file Data path for ICU (Intl object) data. Will extend linked-in data when compiled with small-icu support. NODE_NO_WARNINGS When set to 1, process warnings are silenced. NODE_OPTIONS options... A space-separated list of command-line options, which are interpreted as if they had been specified on the command line before the actual command (so they can be overridden). Node.js will exit with an error if an option that is not allowed in the environment is used, such as --print or a script file. NODE_PATH directories... A colon-separated list of directories prefixed to the module search path. NODE_PENDING_DEPRECATION When set to 1, emit pending deprecation warnings. NODE_PRESERVE_SYMLINKS When set to 1, the module loader preserves symbolic links when resolving and caching modules. NODE_REDIRECT_WARNINGS file Write process warnings to the given file instead of printing to stderr. Equivalent to passing --redirect-warnings file on the command line. NODE_REPL_HISTORY file Path to the file used to store persistent REPL history. The default path is ~/.node_repl_history, which is overridden by this variable. Setting the value to an empty string (\"\" or \" \") will disable persistent REPL history. NODE_REPL_EXTERNAL_MODULE file Path to a Node.js module which will be loaded in place of the built-in REPL. Overriding this value to an empty string (`''`) will use the built-in REPL. NODE_SKIP_PLATFORM_CHECK When set to 1, the check for a supported platform is skipped during Node.js startup. Node.js might not execute correctly. Any issues encountered on unsupported platforms will not be fixed. NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED When set to 0, TLS certificate validation is disabled. NODE_V8_COVERAGE dir When set, Node.js writes JavaScript code coverage information to dir. OPENSSL_CONF file Load an OpenSSL configuration file on startup. Among other uses, this can be used to enable FIPS-compliant crypto if Node.js is built with ./configure --openssl-fips. If the --openssl-config command-line option is used, this environment variable is ignored. SSL_CERT_DIR dir If --use-openssl-ca is enabled, this overrides and sets OpenSSL's directory containing trusted certificates. SSL_CERT_FILE file If --use-openssl-ca is enabled, this overrides and sets OpenSSL's file containing trusted certificates. TZ Specify the timezone configuration. UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE size Sets the number of threads used in libuv's threadpool to size.
