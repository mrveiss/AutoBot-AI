      "analysisResult": "Execute comprehensive system testing to validate all recently restored AutoBot systems within 5-hour timeframe. Test 6 major areas: frontend integration, authentication, security validation, voice system, monitoring, and cross-system integration across distributed VM infrastructure. Use existing robust test framework for immediate validation and issue identification.",
      "summary": "Comprehensive API backend testing successfully completed with detailed analysis of all 36 endpoints across 9 categories. Generated comprehensive test reports identifying 5 critical issues requiring immediate attention. Priority restored systems partially validated: chat workflow (66.7% functional), knowledge base access (50% functional), voice processing (0% - router not registered), monitoring dashboard (40% functional). Overall 33.3% API success rate indicates significant router registration and implementation gaps. Critical findings: Settings API broken (ServiceURLs error), voice router missing, file operations missing, system monitoring missing, knowledge base method missing. Positive: core functionality (health, chat, search, analytics) operational. Test results properly documented in tests/results/ directory following repository standards.",
