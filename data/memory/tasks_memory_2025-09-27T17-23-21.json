Verify existing /src/voice_interface.py imports are working (lines 1-15 handle graceful import failures)\\n3. Test audio device availability: Check microphone and speaker access on target systems\\n4. Update setup.sh to include voice dependencies in fresh installations\\n5. Verify VoiceInterface class initialization in backend/app_factory.py:178 works without errors",

Leverages complete existing framework including VoiceInterface class in /src/voice_interface.py, Vue frontend component, backend API endpoints, and configuration system. Focus on enhancement rather than replacement, with specific integration to orchestrator and agent processing pipeline.",
      "summary": "Voice dependencies successfully restored and verified. Installed speechrecognition==3.10.0, pydub==0.25.1, gtts==2.3.1, and pyttsx3. VoiceInterface class initializes without errors with both Speech Recognition and Text-to-Speech engines available. Backend voice API endpoints (/api/voice/listen, /api/voice/speak) are properly configured. Updated setup.sh script to include voice dependencies for future installations. Voice interface framework is fully operational and ready for enhancement.",
