"""Company OS agent ledger: who is working on what, for the caller's company (#18391).

Read-only except one write. The routes show what the coordination stores already
hold -- presence (#16947), work claims, the waitlist (#15948), pending peer messages
(#16948) and idle subscriptions (#16949) -- and change none of it. There is no
force-release and no delete; claims are released by their holder, and the one
human action the design allows, asking a holder to release (#18599), only publishes
a request.

TENANCY. The company comes from `require_org_context`, never from a request
parameter. Presence, peer messages and idle subscriptions are keyed by tenant and
filtered to the caller's own. Claims, waiters and ledger events are scoped by the
company STAMPED on them when they were written (`autobot_shared/coordination/
claim_company.py`) -- not by agent name, which anyone can choose. A record with no
stamp (install-wide actors such as dev sessions and AI-stack roles, or anything
written before stamping) is invisible here and shown only in the SLM view.

An unreachable store answers HTTP 503 with a typed body, never an empty list
(`autobot_shared/coordination/ledger_http.py`).
