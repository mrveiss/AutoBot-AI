"""A blocked push shows the failing test, not the last 25 lines (#17961).

vitest prints its failures BEFORE its summary, and the hook appends the
dependency-floor report after it, so `tail -25` of a real failure showed only
"Start at", "Duration" and the floor list. That hid the #18495 failure through
five blocked pushes. These tests run the hook's own `failure_excerpt` on
recorded output shapes, rather than a copy of it.
